The '''Imperium of Man''', also called the '''Imperium of Mankind''' and simply the '''Imperium''', is the galactic empire under which the majority of [[humanity]] is united. The founder and nominal ruler of the Imperium is the god-like [[Emperor of Mankind]], the most powerful [[human]] [[psyker]] ever known.{{citethis}}

The Imperium is the largest and most powerful political entity in the [[galaxy]], consisting of at least a million worlds which are dispersed across most of the galaxy. An Imperial planet might be separated from its closest neighbour by hundreds or thousands of light years. As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in terms of contiguous territory, but only in the number of planetary systems in its control.{{citethis}}

Several aliens and forces - [[Chaos]], [[Tyranid]]s, [[Eldar]], [[Dark Eldar]], [[Ork]]s, [[Tau]], [[Necron]]s - challenge the supremacy of the Imperium. From within, the Imperium is threatened more insidiously by rebellion, [[mutation]], rogue [[psyker]]s, and subversive [[Chaos Cult|cult]]s. Without the protection of the Imperium, mankind would fall prey to the countless perils that threaten it.{{citethis}}

==History of the Imperium==
{{Main|Age of the Imperium}}
The Imperium was founded by the Emperor, also called '''The Immortal Emperor''', '''God-Emperor''', and the '''Master of Mankind''', at the end of the [[Age of Strife]] â€” a very long period of anarchy, war, and destructive regression which brought humanity to the brink of destruction and reversed the technological progression made during the [[Dark Age of Technology]]. In the [[Unification Wars]], the Emperor led his proto-[[Astartes]] known as [[Thunder Warriors]] to victory in unifying Terra for the first time in millennia.{{citethis}}

As the [[Warp storm]]s of the Age of Strife subsided, after having secured the scientific posts and spacedocks of [[Luna]], along with the factories and scientists on [[Mars]], the Emperor began to unite mankind under his rule. A vast navy was built, with which his armies undertook the [[Great Crusade]], which lasted for about two centuries. During this two hundred year-long military campaign, the Emperor employed his most potent military units, the [[Space Marine Legion]]s, led by their leaders, the [[Primarch]]s. These, combined with the might of the [[Imperial Army]] (which was later separated into the [[Imperial Guard]] and the [[Imperial Navy]]), [[Custodian Guard]], [[Sisters of Silence]], and [[Martian Mechanicum]] forces that included the [[Collegia Titanica]] and [[Legio Cybernetica]] saw thousands of human worlds brought together under the Imperium. The Great Crusade ended with the corruption and treachery of the Primarch [[Horus]], the instigator of the [[Horus Heresy]].{{citethis}}

The rebellion was fought across the galaxy. Horus, seeking to achieve a swift and decisive victory, led most of the traitor forces in a direct strike at the capital of humanity, in the [[Battle of Terra]]. In the final decisive battle between the Emperor and the Arch-Traitor, Horus was slain, leading to the breakup of the rebellion and the exile of the traitors to the [[Eye of Terror]]. However the Master of Mankind was himself mortally wounded. According to his instructions he was placed on the life-preserving [[Golden Throne]], where, for nearly ten thousand years, he has remained. Though physically a carcass incapable of movement or communication, his omnipotent will extends across the million worlds of the Imperium, beaming the psychic energy of the [[Astronomican]], soul-binding psychic humans and struggling against the [[daemon]]s of the Warp. He endures by his undying will, and by the sustenance that only the souls of sacrificial [[psyker]]s can provide. By the numberless masses of humanity he is worshiped as a god.{{citethis}}

The immediate period following the Heresy, [[The Scouring]] and [[Age of Rebirth]], saw the Imperium slowly rebuild its might and control over the domain of man. It also saw the last of the Emperor's loyal Primarchs either fall in battle, become gravely wounded, or disappear altogether. Nonetheless in the subsequent age known as [[The Forging]], the Imperium enjoyed a period of growth and expansion. The Imperium's period of relative peace ended abruptly in mid-[[M32]] when an [[Ork]] [[Warboss]] known only as [[The Beast]] launched the [[War of the Beast|greatest Waaagh! ever encountered]]. The Beast was only halted at great cost by the [[Adeptus Astartes]].{{Fn|3e}} 

The Imperium saw further periods of severe instability throughout [[M35]] and [[M36]], experiencing civil wars during the [[Nova Terra Interregnum]] and [[Age of Apostasy]]. This period saw the worst internal violence since the Heresy. Following the Age of Apostasy, the Imperium was again heavily reorganized and many [[heretic]]s purged in the [[Age of Redemption]]. This new fervor culminated in a series of major [[Crusade]]s and [[War of Faith|Wars of Faith]] most notably the [[Redemption Crusades]] and [[Macharian Crusade]]. However, while successful, this period exhausted the Imperium's military forces and in [[The Waning]], many worlds were lost to [[xenos]] and [[Chaos]] attacks as well as internal rebellion.{{Fn|3e}}

The effects of The Waning ultimately culminated in late [[M41]], known as the [[Time of Ending]]. Here the exhausted Imperium not only faced rejuvenated old threats, but also terrifying new enemies like the [[Tyranid]]s and [[Necron]]s as well new smaller but dynamic alien empires such as the [[Tau]], [[Noisome Reek]], and [[Ulumeathic League]]. Beset on all sides by [[heresy]] and alien invasion, the future of the Imperium seems bleak.{{Fn|3e}} The Black Crusade saw both the destruction of [[Cadia]] and the formation of the [[Great Rift]], which has effectively split the Imperium in two. However some hope has been renewed thanks to the rebirth of the Primarch [[Roboute Guilliman]], who has launched the [[Indomitus Crusade]] to reclaim worlds lost within the [[Imperium Nihilus|Dark Imperium]].{{citethis}}

====Warzones====
The Imperium is an entity beset by constant war. However a number of current engagements stand out as particularly fearsome. These include:{{Fn|27a}}
*[[13th Black Crusade|War Zone Cadia]] - Though [[Cadia]] itself was smashed at the end of the [[13th Black Crusade]], Imperial forces throughout the [[Cadian Sector]] continue to attempt to hold back the tides of [[Chaos]].{{Fn|27a}}
*'''War Zone Nachmund''' including the [[War of Beasts]] and [[Nachmund Rift War]] - The Imperium is battling to hold the strategically vital [[Nachmund Gauntlet]] from a variety of foes including [[Orks]], [[Chaos]], [[Genestealer Cult]]s, and [[Eldar]]{{Fn|27a}}{{Fn|36}}.
*[[Angel's Halo|War Zone Baal]] - Following their narrow victory in the [[Devastation of Baal]], the [[Blood Angels]] are leading a major offensive throughout the [[Red Scar]] against the [[Tyranids]].{{Fn|27a}}
*[[War in the Rift|War Zone Ultramar]] - As a result of the [[Plague Wars]] the realm of [[Ultramar]] is now beset by not only the Forces of [[Nurgle]] but also the [[Tyranids]].{{Fn|27a}}
*[[Pariah Crusade|War Zone Pariah]] - Within the [[Nephilim Sector]] the Imperium has begun to move on the [[Pariah Nexus]] in an attempt to foil the machinations of the [[Necrons]].{{Fn|27a}}
*[[Third War for Armageddon|War Zone Armageddon]] - Imperial forces continue to fight back both [[Orks]] and [[Daemons]] on the world of [[Armageddon]]. The 3rd Ork invasion of Armageddon under [[Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka]] has splintered off into a massive [[Waaagh!]] known as [[Da Great Waaagh!]].{{Fn|27b}}
*[[Prosperan Rift War|War Zone Prospero]] - Imperial forces resist the forces of [[Tzeentch]] under [[Magnus the Red]] around the [[Prosperan Rift]].{{Fn|28}}
*[[Fifth Sphere of Expansion]] - The Imperium battles the expanding [[T'au Empire]] around the [[Nem'yar Atoll]] and [[Chalnath Expanse]]{{Fn|27c}}.
*[[Octarius War|War Zone Octarius]] - As a result of Inquisitor [[Kryptman]]'s actions to stop [[Hive Fleet Leviathan]] by having it clash with the [[Ork Empire of Octarius]], the situation has become so dire that Inquisitor [[Nashir Sahansun]] has enacted the [[Cordon Impenetra]] to delay the advances of the xenos.{{Fn|34a}}
*[[Fourth Tyrannic War]] - Currently focused around [[Segmentum Pacificus]] as the Imperium attempts to stem the advance of a major offensive by [[Hive Fleet Leviathan]].{{Fn|38}}

==Political Structure==
{{main|High Lords of Terra}}
The Imperium is still nominally ruled by the Emperor of Mankind. However, since his ascension to the [[Golden Throne]], the duty of actually ruling the Imperium falls to the '''Senatorum Imperialis''' â€” the Imperial Senate, led by the twelve [[High Lords of Terra]]. The identities and responsibilities of these High Lords may vary, as individuals inevitably die and their influence grows and wanes, but its members are always the leaders and representatives of the most powerful Imperial organisations.{{citethis}}

This system endured for ten thousand years until the end of the [[41st Millennium]], when the revived Primarch [[Roboute Guilliman]] became [[Lord Commander of the Imperium]] and ruled over even the High Lords.{{Fn|12}}

===Imperial Organisations===
[[Image:ImpHierarchy.png|frame|center|208px|Organisation of the Imperial government.{{Fn|3e}}]]

The Imperial government is divided into four main bodies: the [[Adeptus Terra]] (The Priesthood of Terra), the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] (the Priesthood of Mars), the [[Adeptus Ministorum]] (State Church), and [[Inquisition]] (Secret Police). These in turn answer to the [[Senatorum Imperialis]], who rule in the name of the [[Emperor]]. In practice, most of the organisations comprising the Imperium are divisions of the vast [[Adeptus Terra]]. There are countless divisions, and some are so secretive their existence is known only to a few. The most well-known of the &quot;secret&quot; organisations is the [[Officio Assassinorum]]. Other organisations are secret enough that nothing besides their mere existence is known, such as the [[Officio Sabatorum]] and the [[Templars Psykologis]].{{Fn|3e}}

The most important and well-known Imperial organisations include:
*The [[Adeptus Terra]], which includes:
**The [[Adeptus Administratum]] â€” Responsible for administrative functions, it is the largest division, numbering countless scribes and petty officials. It administers the Imperium at every level, assessing [[tithe]]s and taxes, conducting population censuses, recording and planning. It consists of innumerable subdivisions, offices and departments.{{Fn|3a}}
***The [[Departmento Munitorum]] â€” A department of the Administratum, responsible for administering and supplying the [[Imperial Guard]].{{Fn|3a}}
****The [[Ordo Tempestus]] â€” Elite military force.{{citethis}}

***The [[Questio Logisticus]] - Estimates length of [[Warp Jump]]s{{Fn|23}}
**The [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] â€” The Imperium's network of [[astropath]]s, responsible for transmitting faster-than-light messages through the Imperium.{{Fn|3a}}
***The [[League of Black Ships]] â€” Psyker-gatherers.{{citethis}}
***The [[Scholastia Psykana]] â€” Trains [[Sanctioned Psyker]]s{{citethis}}
**The [[Adeptus Astronomica]] â€” Responsible for maintaining the [[Astronomican]], which is used by the [[Navigator]]s to navigate through the Warp.{{Fn|3a}}

*The [[Inquisition]] â€” A secret police and internal affairs organization, they are responsible for investigating any potential threat to mankind or the Imperium. Its agents hunt down [[heretic]]s, traitors, alien infiltrators and even daemons. They necessarily exist beyond the Adeptus Terra's authority, as part of the Inquisition's role involves rooting out corruption and gross incompetence from the Imperium itself. They answer only to the Emperor and to themselves.{{Fn|3a}}

**[[Schola Progenium]] â€” An Orphange &amp; civil servant training institute.{{citethis}}
**[[Shrine World]]s

===Military===
As the largest single known polity in the Galaxy, the Imperium maintains a wide array of military forces. At any given times there are countless billions fighting for the Imperium of Man. Similar to its political organization each branch of the Imperiumâ€™s military is independent, with their own duties, rituals, chain of command, tactical acumen and gear of war. Though diverse, the forces of the Imperium often work in conjunction with each other, and the larger the battle, the more likely it will be to see multiple Imperial factions engaged in the same war. Massive conflagrations, such as the [[Chaos]] invasions known as the [[Black Crusade]]s or a major war zone such as the one surrounding the planet [[Armageddon]], will attract representatives from all of Mankindâ€™s military institutions.{{Fn|13}}

The military forces of the Imperium consist of:
*[[Planetary Defense Forces]] â€” Often abbreviated to '''PDFs'''. These are independent armies raised and commanded by the Governors of individual Imperial worlds. Though poorly trained and equipped compared to the rest of the Imperium's forces, they serve as the first line of defense.{{Fn|13}}
*The [[Imperial Guard]] â€” The largest single military arm of the Imperium, consisting of vast armies of unaugmented human [[Guardsmen]]. It falls under the control of the [[Administratum]]'s Departmento Munitorum.{{Fn|13}}
**The [[Ordo Tempestus]] â€” Elite forces of the [[Departmento Munitorum]]{{citethis}}
*The [[Imperial Navy]] â€” The military branch of the [[Imperial Fleet]]. Consists of large warfleets of spacecraft tasked with not only space combat but also transporting the [[Imperial Guard]].{{Fn|13}}
**The [[Aeronautica Imperialis]] â€” Atmospheric warfare branch of the Imperial Navy{{citethis}}
*The [[Space Marines]] â€” Elite genetically modified warriors divided into independent armies known as [[Chapter]]s.{{Fn|13}}
*The [[Sisters of Battle]] â€” The all-female military arm of the Imperial church, the [[Ecclesiarchy]].{{Fn|13}}
*The military forces of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]], which include:
**The [[Collegia Titanica]] â€” Operates Legions of titantic warmachines known as [[Imperial Titan|Titan]]s{{Fn|13}}
**The [[Legiones Skitarii]] â€” Cybernetic soldiers that act as the standing armies of [[Forge World]]s.{{Fn|13}}
**Other miscellaneous smaller and specialized armed wings including the [[Electro-Priest|Electro-Priesthood]], [[Legio Cybernetica]], [[Ordo Reductor]], [[Auxilia Myrmidon]], [[Centurio Ordinatus]], and [[Basilikon Astra|Fleet]]. These are often deployed together in formations known as [[Cult Mechanicus Battle Congregation|Battle Congregations]].{{Fn|15}}
*The [[Imperial Knights]], which include [[Knight House|Houses]] sworn to the [[Adeptus Terra]] or Adeptus Mechanicus.{{Fn|36a}}
**[[Knight Household Guard]] - Support militia of Knight Houses.{{Fn|36a}}
*The [[Sisters of Silence]] â€” [[Psyker]]-hunters of the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] and guards of the [[League of Black Ships|Black Ships]].{{Fn|13}}
*The [[Adeptus Custodes]] â€” The elite guardians of the [[Emperor]]. For most of the Imperium's history they have remained at the [[Imperial Palace]] but recently have ventured forth on [[Crusade]]s.{{citethis}}
*The forces of the [[Inquisition]] â€” Besides the [[Inquisitor]]s and their [[Inquisitorial Henchmen|retinue]]s, the Inquisition's forces include:{{Fn|13}}
**The [[Grey Knights]] â€” [[Chamber Militant]] of the [[Ordo Malleus]]{{citethis}}
**The [[Deathwatch]] â€” Chamber Militant of the [[Ordo Xenos]]{{citethis}}
**The [[Sisters of Battle]] â€” Chamber Militant of the [[Ordo Hereticus]]{{citethis}}
**[[Inquisitorial Stormtrooper]]s - Standard soldiers which act as the guards and enforcers of the Inquisition.
**Independent fleet assets which include [[Inquisitorial Black Ship]]s and [[Inquisitorial Cruiser]]s.{{citethis}}

*The [[Order Elucidatum]] - The secret police of [[Malcador the Sigillite]].
*The [[Thunder Warriors]] â€” The earliest known genetically modified supersoldiers of the Imperium. Were led by the [[Emperor]] himself in the [[Unification Wars]]. Replaced by the Legiones Astartes
[[Image:9thEdMap.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Current map of the [[Imperium]]{{Fn|27}}]]

==Imperial Domain==
[[Image:ImperiumMap7th.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Pre-[[Great Rift]] Map of the Imperium{{Fn|4}}]]
[[Image:SegGalacticPic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Segmentae]] of the Imperium]]

The disparate and widespread nature of Imperial territory means that a strongly centralised government would be unfeasible. The Imperium divides the galaxy into five administrative zones called [[Segmentae Majoris]]:
*[[Segmentum Solar]] â€” inner core and heart of the Imperium.
*[[Segmentum Pacificus]]
*[[Segmentum Obscurus]] â€” a heavily-fortified region due to the dangers posed by its most infamous element, the Eye of Terror.
*[[Segmentum Tempestus]]
*[[Ultima Segmentum]] â€” the largest province of all; its furthest extents are beyond the range of the Astronomican.

The Segmentae are the Imperium's primary administrative division. Each is divided into [[sector]]s, which are areas of space. The sectors in turn consist of [[subsector]]s, each containing a number of star [[system]]s which in turn are made up of individual worlds. These divisions and subdivisions are levels forming an administrative hierarchy. Each Segmentum Commander oversees his [[Sector Lord|Sector Commanders]], who in turn oversees Subsector Commanders, who oversee the individual [[Planetary Governor]]s. The higher ranks in this system are usually combined with a basic planetary governorship as well as interplanetary duties. This system is the means by which the Imperium maintains control of the separate planets that comprise it.

The borders of the Imperium are marked by several uncharted regions of space which lay beyond the range of the [[Astronomican]], areas which are frequently viewed with uncertainty and fear by Imperial citizens.{{Fn|5}} These include the [[Halo Zone]] on the Imperium's western-most border, the [[Halo Stars]] to its northwest, the [[Ghoul Stars]] to its northeast, the [[Veiled Region]] and [[Mandragoran Stars]] to its south, and the [[Eastern Fringes]] to its eastern-most border.

Following the [[Thirteenth Black Crusade]] and the resurrection of [[Roboute Guilliman]], much of the Imperium's northwestern frontier became cut off from Terra. Becoming known as [[Imperium Nihilus]], Guilliman has launched a new [[Crusade]] to reclaim these worlds.{{Fn|11}} The region south of the rift has become known as [[Imperium Sanctus]].{{Fn|27}}

===Planetary Classification===
Due to its vast magnitude, the Imperium can afford for entire worlds to become specialised places where a majority, perhaps even the entirety, of the population is devoted to a single task. This could be heavy industry, military training, manufacturing, mining or agriculture.

===Planetary Administration===
Because of the distances involved and the unstable nature of Warp communication, [[Planetary Governor]]s generally operate very autonomously. This allows quite a lot of variation in the regional governments. Most governorships are hereditary, but it is also possible for a planet to have an elected Planetary Governor, a tyrant Governor who rules by force of arms, or anything in between. So long as the Governor fulfills his duties to the Imperium, his rule will generally be accepted by the higher authorities. A rare few Planetary Governors preside over [[Feral World|feral]] or [[Feudal World|medieval worlds]] where the Imperium has not, for whatever reason, seen fit to introduce modern technology. These Governors are often isolated from their subjects, sometimes even living on orbital installations, only interfering to control mutation and psykers, as well as to collect the modest tithes these planets pay.

The Imperial duties of a Planetary Governor include paying the planetary tithe to the Administratum, controlling psykers, mutation and heresy among the population, defending the planet and putting down rebellions against the local government (and thus against the Imperium). A serious responsibility is the maintenance of an adequate planetary defense force capable of defending the planet in the event of invasion. The [[Planetary Defence Forces]] (abbreviated to PDF) are expected to defeat attacks from minor foes, and in the case of major invasions to hold out until reinforcements arrive, which could take a period of months or even years.

A relatively small number of Imperial worlds are not ruled by a Governor, but are overseen by an alternate organisation such as the Adeptus Terra, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Guard or Space Marines. These include the [[Forge World]]s of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]], whose inhabitants toil without pause to manufacture the weapons of the Emperor's armies (including [[Mars]], [[Gryphonne IV]] and [[Fortis Binary]]), the [[Cardinal World]]s of the Ecclesiarchy, which are given entirely over to education and worship of the Emperor ([[Ignatius Cardinal]], [[Ophelia VII]]), and the Space Marine [[Adeptus Astartes Homeworld|Chapter planets]] (such as [[Fenris]], [[Macragge]], [[Baal]], and [[Medusa (Planet)|Medusa]]).

====Rebellion====
The Imperial creed maintains that all of humanity must be brought into and kept within the Imperium. Several Imperial organisations are permanently occupied with suppressing any possibility of rebellion before they have a chance of developing. The common worship of the Emperor holds mankind together and instills loyalty towards the Imperium. Rebellions and uprisings on Imperial planets nonetheless remain constant. The nature and causes of a rebellion can fall into several categories: the government of an Imperial world may decide to secede from the Imperium, or may attempt to overthrow the local Imperial government. In the most insidious of cases the rebellion may be brought about by xenos or Chaos influence. In the more prosaic cases however, a government established through rebellion is not necessarily opposed by the Imperium, so long as it accedes fully to Imperial authority.{{Fn|2}}

Besides outright war, there are many ways a rebellious world may be brought back into the Imperium. With its more secretive organisations, the Imperium is fully capable of carrying out subvert methods of restoring Imperial rule, including assassination, popular agitation, economic sabotage and terrorism. Sometimes a rebellion can be subdued by the removal of a single individual. Pro-Imperial groups or other anti-government forces can be infiltrated or supported.{{Fn|1}}

==Culture==
*{{main|Imperial Culture}}
*{{Main|Food and Drink of the Imperium}}
*{{Main|Narcotics}}
While types of regimes and cultures differ greatly from world to world, there are commonly shared values and policies maintained by the Imperial central government. The worship of the [[Emperor]] as a god and the need for subject planets to pay the [[Imperial Tithe]] are rigidly enforced by agencies such as the [[Ecclesiarchy]], [[Adeptus Arbites]], and the feared [[Inquisition]].{{Fn|3a}} In addition, the Imperium is militantly xenophobic and will annihilate entire [[xenos|non-human]] species. Besides aliens, [[Mutant]]s and [[psyker]]s also face ruthless persecution{{Fn|3c}}, though certain types of [[Abhuman]]s such as [[Ogryn]]s and [[Ratling]]s are tolerated. The Imperium views their violently xenophobic, anti-mutant, and anti-psyker policies as necessary for the survival of the human race amid a galaxy of violent aliens and [[Chaos|dark gods]].{{Fn|3b}}{{Fn|3c}}

In addition to aliens, mutants, and psykers, most forms of robotics and artificial intelligence are outlawed in the Imperium. This taboo was inherited from human civilizations of the [[Dark Age of Technology]], who were nearly annihilated at the hands of the legendary [[Iron Men]].{{Fn|6}} Thus while certain forms of robotics such as [[Servitor]]s and [[Machine Spirit]]s are sanctioned, any kind of true artificial sentience is declared to be a heretical [[Abominable Intelligence]].

Everyday life differs greatly in the Imperium depending on which world one finds themselves on. However there is a common uniting factor: all activities are based around service to the Emperor and his regime. Life is often monotonous, with those on [[Hive World]]s spending their days as factory laborers before a short sleep cycle inside a cramped living quarters. Materialism outside of the nobility is virtually unknown. Whatever entertainment exists is heavily monitored by the [[Ecclesiarchy]] and is usually religious or political in nature. Most recreation is achieved through religious festivals, music, and drinking. Many, particularly those who can not find fulfillment outside of worship to the Emperor, resort to [[Narcotics|drug]] use to escape the reality of their lives. There are parks and shows for the nobility, but these are too expensive for a commoner to enjoy. On particular regressive worlds, gladiatorial combat may be used for entertainment. Against this backdrop most families will attempt to live a quiet humble life, hoping to never encounter the gaze of Imperial authorities or the horrors of the Galaxy.{{Fn|24}}

Making the sign of the [[Aquila]] is a common display of loyalty and respect within the Imperium. This is achieved through moving ones hands together into the shape of a double-headed eagle.{{Fn|22}}

===Imperial Languages===
[[Low Gothic]] is the common tongue of the Imperium, spoken on most Imperial planets as a first or second language. Imperial worlds have inevitably developed their own dialects of Low Gothic over time. [[High Gothic]] (represented as Latinised English) dates from an age before the Imperium, and is used solely as a hieratic tongue by the divisions of the Adeptus Terra, the Inquisition and the Ecclesiarchy. Another prominent language of the Imperium is the [[Lingua Technis]], the tongue of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]].{{Fn|25}}

===Religion===
*{{Main|Imperial Cult}}
*{{Main|Ecclesiarchy}}
The Imperium's state religion, the '''Imperial Cult''', is the one and only faith under Imperial law. While forms of worship may differ, they share a common belief that the [[Emperor]] is a God and the master of Mankind. This state religion is overseen by the [[Ecclesiarchy]], the Imperial church and one of the most powerful and influential organizations among humanity. Any kind of deviation or apostasy against the Imperial Cult is classified as [[heresy]] and punishable by death.{{Fn|3d}} The exception falls to the [[Cult Mechanicus]], the state religion of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]]. Since the [[Treaty of Olympus]] millennia ago their faith has been granted tolerance. While the Cult Mechanicus differs greatly from the tenets of the Ecclesiarchy in its reverence of the machine, it nonetheless worships the Emperor as the divine avatar of the [[Machine God]] known as the [[Omnissiah]].{{Fn|25}}

However other illegal faiths are practiced covertly by denizens of the Imperium, most notably among persecuted classes such as [[mutant]]s. Unfortunately, it is common that often times this involves worship of the [[Chaos Gods|Dark Gods]].{{Fn|3c}}

==Economy==
Wealth in the Imperium is distributed highly unequally, and those below are expected to serve those above. The Imperium primarily collects its wealth through its [[Tithe]]s maintained on each world. Many types of currency in the Imperium exist, such as '''Credits'''{{Fn|8}}, '''Crowns'''{{Fn|9}}, '''Aquilas'''{{Fn|22}}, and '''Thrones'''{{Fn|10}}. Often goods, resources, and manpower are substituted as currency on a planetary level.{{Fn|3e}}

Examples of standard income in the Imperium is as follows, with the Thrones currency used. This however applies only to Acolytes of each profession.{{Fn|10}}

==Travel==
*{{Main|Warp jump}}
Interstellar Travel in the Imperium is a perilous affair. Most travel is conducted by the [[Imperial Fleet]], specifically the [[Merchant Fleet]] which oversees 90% of interstellar traffic.{{Fn|21}} In order to travel at [[FTL|Faster-than-light]] and thus reach their destination within a reasonable amount of time, Imperial vessels must activate their vessels [[Warp Drive]] and enter the [[Immaterium]]. While inside the Warp, genetically modified Humans known as [[Navigator]]s use the [[Terra]]n-based [[Astronomican]] as a beacon to guide their vessel to its destination. Many threats exist during Warp Travel, from the terrifying prospect of [[Gellar Field]] failure to temporal inconsistencies to massive [[Warp Storm]]s.{{Fn|1a}}

==Communication==
*{{Main|Astropath}}
While short-range more conventional methods exist, within the Imperium the only reliable means of rapid interstellar communication is by utilizing a type of [[Psychic]] Human known as an [[Astropath]]. Astropaths send telepathic messages into the Warp which are then intercepted by other Astropaths and passed along until they reach their intended destination. Astropathic Communication is fraught with inconsistencies and are not always reliable, with messages becoming garbled or being delivered well after or even before the time in which they were originally sent.{{Fn|1b}}

==Imperial Dating System==
*{{main|Imperial Dating System}}
The Imperial dating system is based upon &quot;Anno Domini&quot;, although expressed in rather different terms. A full dating code consists of a &quot;check&quot; number, &quot;year fraction&quot; number, &quot;year&quot; number, and the millennium. The millennium is a suffix, represented by an &quot;M&quot; and the millennium number. The three digits preceding the millennium is the year within the millennium, running from 001-000 (one thousand). For example 0150930/M32 is the year 930 of the thirty second millennium (31,930 A.D.).

Since the formation of the [[Great Rift]], the Imperium has introduced a radical new dating system to compensate for the extreme inconsistencies of time that has taken place across the galaxy. This is based around the planet's time in relation to the formation of the Rift itself.{{Fn|16}}

[[Image:Administratum Symbol.jpg|thumb|80px|right|Symbol of the Administratum{{Fn|9b}}]]
The '''Adeptus Administratum''' is the administrative and bureaucratic division of the [[Adeptus Terra]], consisting of untold billions of clerks, scribes and administrative staff constantly working to manage the [[Imperium]] at every level, from assembling war fleets to levying taxes.  It is the largest of the departments comprising the Adeptus Terra - the mere administration of the [[Imperial Palace]] is estimated to involve over ten billion adepts.{{Fn|1a}}

==Overview==
[[Image:Adept of Administratum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Adept]] of the Administratum{{Fn|9a}}]]
The Administratum was created as the Imperial Administration, and was under the control of [[Malcador (Character)|Malcador]], titled the Chief of the Imperial Administration.{{Cite This}}

Billions of Administratum officials on [[Terra]] and throughout the [[galaxy]] are constantly carrying out population censuses, working out tithes, recording and archiving information, and the million other things that are necessary for the running of the [[Imperium]].  Such is its immense size and complex bureaucracy that whole Administratum departments have been lost and forgotten.  So dogmatically bureaucratic, whole departments of adepts continue to diligently but purposelessly carry out the role their department was founded for, even after the department has become long obsolete. Of all the Imperium's divisions, the Administratum is regarded as the least prestigious, but its high ranking members are among the most powerful men in the Imperium.  Despite its massive inefficiency, the Administratum is so integral to the running of the Imperium, that without it, the whole Imperium would grind to a halt.  As a result, the [[Master of the Administratum]] is the most powerful member of the [[High Lords of Terra]]. Many Administratum positions are hereditary; parents pass on their ranks and positions to their children, who continue the work that had occupied the lives of their ancestors.  Typical Administratum [[adepts]] labour within gargantuan vaults, sitting at logic-engines and can be considered learned by Imperial standards.{{Cite This}}

Like other non-combatant servants of the Adeptus Terra, the members of the Administratum wear a monastic style of dress, their habits varying in colour according to rank and area of responsibility.  The basic color for the lowliest scribe is black - higher-ranking members have increasingly lighter shades of grey, and eventually pure white.{{Fn|2}} While the Administratum as a whole is primarily responsible for all logistical operations relating to the civil aspects of the Imperium, one of its departments, the [[Departmento Munitorum]] is responsible for the logistics of the [[Imperial Guard]], organising military tithes, troop movements and troop deployment.{{Cite This}}

Despite holding sway over untold trillions and managing a galactic bureaucracy, the Administratum's primary method of record keeping and distribution of information is [[Wikipedia: Vellum|Vellum]]. Parchment not only appeals to the dogmatic values and traditionalism of the Administratum, but is also considered a far more secure and cheaper a method of data collection than electronic counterparts such as [[Data-Slate]]s or [[Cogitator]]s while being far more durable than standard paper. Enormous amounts of Vellum is produced from the hides of [[Porcine]] bred on [[Agri-World]]s or artificially grown in bio-vats. Vellum is a prized resource in the Imperium, so much so that inter-agency wars have been fought over it and wealthy familial dynasties solely dedicated to the creation of parchment exist. Legions of Administratum scribes work tirelessly upon Vellum, consuming untold amounts of the parchment in their endless recording of data. It is said that Vellum is the 7th largest import to [[Terra]] in sheer weight due to the demands of the Imperial bureaucracy. The Administratum itself seems aware of the inefficiency of written record over more modern methods, but nonetheless does not change.{{Fn|11}}

==Divisions of the Administratum==
[[Image:Administratum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An adept of the Administratum{{Fn|1a}}]]
The Administratum is comprised of innumerable divisions and offices. Each office or department is involved in some specific aspect of administration, most of them are petty and of little interest.{{Fn|1a}} Known divisions are listed below:

*The [[Departmento Munitorum]] - Oversees the massive logistics and management of the [[Imperial Guard]]
*The [[Departmento Exacta]] - Oversees the collection of [[Imperial Tithe]]
*The [[Estate Imperium]] - Record keeping department{{Fn|7}}
*The [[Historical Revision Unit]]{{Fn|1a}} - Revises historical records that may be 'subversive' to Imperial rule
*The [[Imperial Fleet]] and its three components: the [[Imperial Navy]], [[Merchant Fleet]], and [[Civil Fleet]].{{Fn|8}}
*The [[Departmento Colonia]] - Deals with issues of planetary colonization{{Fn|19}}
*The [[Logis Strategos]] - Intelligence and threat-analysis agency{{Fn|3}}
*The [[Officio Assassinorum]] - Secretive assassination organization{{Fn|8}}
*The [[Officio Sabatorum]]{{Cite this}}
*The [[Officio Agricultae]] - food management agency
*The [[Officio Medicae]] - medical agency
*The [[Ordo Tempestus]] - Elite military force that includes [[Tempestus Scions]] and [[Commissars]]{{Cite this}}
*The [[Officio Logisticarum]] - Logistical agency that oversaw the [[Indomitus Crusade]]{{Fn|10}}
*The [[Tithes Chamber Notaries, sub. Planetary Census (Abhumans)]] - Deals with [[Abhuman]] affairs.{{Fn|8}}
*The [[Departmento of Final Consideration]] - Manages the various requests for aid from other Imperial worlds{{Fn|17}}
*The [[Departmento Processium]] - Processes paperwork{{Fn|17a}}
*The [[Departmento Contagio]] - Studies infectious disease{{Fn|17b}}
*The [[Departmento Gradio]] - Assigns ranking grades to letters and documents{{Fn|17c}}
*The [[Astra Cartographica]] - Star mapping agency{{Fn|17d}}
*The [[Questio Logisticus]] - Estimates the length of [[Warp Jump]]s between worlds{{Fn|18}}
*The [[Literati]] - Armed enforcers and security guards{{Fn|17e}}
*[[Imperial Commander]]s{{Fn|8}}
*[[Rogue Trader]]s{{Fn|8}}

==Ranks and titles of the Administratum==
There are countless ranks and titles used within the Administratum; the system is also used within the Adeptus Terra as a whole.{{Fn|1a}} Some examples include:

*The [[Master of the Administratum]] - The titular head of the organization and one of the High Lords of Terra{{Fn|1a}}
*The '''Master Logisticar''' - Senior position{{Fn|6}}
*[[Adept]]us (or Adept) - The title of all members of the Adeptus Terra, from the highest ranking to the most petty of functionaries{{Fn|1a}}
*[[Prefect]]us (or Prefect) - Officers and officials{{Fn|1a}}
*[[Master (Administratum)|Masters]] - Departmental heads{{Fn|1a}}
*[[Ordinate]]s - Minor administrative officials{{Fn|1a}}
*[[Curator]]s - Maintains the ancient records of the Imperium; the rank also requires associated historical and linguistic knowledge{{Fn|1b}}
*[[Scribe]]s - Lowly functionaries responsible for keeping records{{Fn|1a}}
*[[Cipher]]s - Special form of messengers; they memorize dictation with a single scan, repeating it verbatim when they reach their destination; they have no knowledge of the messages they carry{{Fn|1b}}
*[[Menial]]s - Lowly non-specialized workers recruited from the non-adept population{{Fn|1b}}
*[[Subordinate]]s - Hereditary slaves who serve as engineers, craftsmen, etc, as well as in unskilled occupations{{Fn|1b}}

The '''Adeptus Arbites''' are the police force of the [[Adeptus Terra]], devoted to enforcing Imperial law throughout the entire [[Imperium]]. Utterly dedicated and without mercy, the Arbites are feared throughout the [[galaxy]], for they are the agents of a harsh law, where failure and incompetence are crimes, and the only punishment is death. Arbites are empowered to act as judge, jury and executioner â€“ [[Imperial citizen|citizen]]s have no rights, and only members of the [[Priesthood of Terra]] or the [[Inquisition]] could claim anything so elaborate as a trial.{{Fn|1}}

==History==
The Adeptus Arbites date from at least the [[Great Crusade]], when compliant worlds had [[Lord Marshal (Arbites)|Lord Marshal]]'s Offices installed to deal with 'non-local' matters.{{Fn|11}} During the [[Horus Heresy]], the [[Grand Provost Marshal]] of the Arbites was part of the [[War Council]].{{Fn|17}}
[[Image:ArbitesBattle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Arbites battles a [[Defiler]] ]]

During the [[War of the Beast]], the significant Arbites garrison on [[Terra]] saw heavy action against the [[Ork]] [[Attack Moon]] over the Throneworld. The Arbites took catastrophic losses in the failed [[Proletarian Crusade]], and its surviving Terran contingent struggled to maintain order on Terra as upheavals caused by the Greenskin presence broke out.{{Fn|15}}

During the [[Age of Apostasy]], the Adeptus Arbites fell under the control of [[Goge Vandire]].{{Fn|16}}

Following [[The Blackness]], the Arbites struggled to contain the situation on Terra as [[Chaos Cult]]s activated across the planet and billions more of starving and maddened citizens rioted. Ultimately, most of the Arbites stations were overrun as only the [[Imperial Palace]] complex remained secure. Order was eventually restored following the [[Battle of Lion's Gate]] and the arrival of [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|19}} The Arbites later aided Guilliman in his purge of Imperial bureaucracy that became known as the [[Primarch's Scourge]].{{Fn|20}}

==Overview==
===Jurisdiction===
The Adeptus Arbites enforce the ''[[Lex Imperialis]]'', embodied within the great [[Book of Judgement]]. Their organisation represents the soldiers and police of the Adeptus Terra.{{Fn|2}} Each of the Imperium's worlds has its own government, laws, and its own [[Enforcer|local police forces]] to enforce those laws. The Arbites concern themselves only with the enforcement of the broader laws to which the entire Imperium is subject; the common duty of the Arbites is overseeing that the [[Governor]] of each world is regularly paying his planet's [[Tithe]]. In the event of a rogue Governor or a major revolt which threatens Imperial rule, the Arbites will brutally intervene to restore order,{{Fn|14}} though a planetary coup headed up by someone who will fulfill their duties to the Imperium will merely be observed, as a successful revolt by such a one just means that a weak ruler has been replaced.{{Fn|25}} As a result of their constant oversight, the presence of Arbites are often a source of discontent for Governors, but something they must nonetheless tolerate.{{Fn|14}} The Arbites do not trouble themselves with murder, theft, abuse, or slavery unless those things are majorly affecting production quotas, system or subsector economies, or involve non-violent interactions with [[xenos]]. Instead they monitor the number of people being sent to serve in the [[Astra Militarum]]; how efficiently unsanctioned [[psyker]]s and [[mutant]]s are being rounded up; whether those who foment rebellion are being shut down before they can spread their message; and if dangerous [[narcotics]] are taking hold of the population of a world. Void ships belonging to merchants, and even [[Rogue trader]]s can be boarded by Arbites with no notice - sometimes, just to instill fear into their hearts, but most times to genuinely search for forbidden cargo.{{Fn|25}}

===Organisation===
The overall leader of the Adeptus Arbites is the [[Grand Provost Marshal]], who represents the organization on the [[Senatorum Imperialis]] and oversees the organization at the [[Hall of Judgement]] on [[Terra]]. Below him are the [[Marshals of the Court]] which oversee galaxy-spanning precincts.{{Fn|2}} Below the Marshals of the Court, the Arbites are internally divided into two subgroups; [[Judge]]s, who deal with legal matters and the application of ten thousand years of case law and its precedents, and [[Arbitrators]], the militant arm of the Arbites who perform the work necessary to apprehend and punish those who break the Emperor's laws. Senior Arbites fulfill both roles, with Judges getting their hands dirty, and Arbitrators learning to preside over lengthy court trials.{{Cite This}}

The Adeptus Arbites maintains a presence on almost every Imperial world, headquartered in fortified Precinct-Fortresses{{Fn|14}} also known as Courthouses. The courthouses are equipped to be self-sufficient and to support a complete Arbites army. They consist of armouries, dungeons, barracks, firing ranges, scriptories, archives, warehouses, kitchens, gymnasia and garages. Courthouses are sometimes a world's only connection with the rest of the Imperium.{{Fn|2}}{{Fn|3}}

===Personnel===
The women and men of the Adeptus Arbites are utterly devoted to their task and without mercy to those who break the Lex Imperialis. Arbites are usually recruited through the [[Schola Progenium]], often those who have displayed great force of will and brute strength.{{Fn|8}}
[[Image:ArbitesFortress.jpg|thumb|right|A Typical Precinct-Fortress of the Adeptus Arbites]]

===Equipment===
*{{Main|Adeptus Arbites Armoury}}
The Adeptus Arbites are equipped to fight a minor war, but their main role is maintaining order. A single precinct courthouse functions as a base for a complete and fully-equipped army, capable of fielding vehicles. In combat Arbitrators wear [[carapace armour]]. Heavy gloves and boots protect the hands and feet, while the head is encased within an all-enclosing helmet equipped with a [[rebreather]].{{Cite This}}

Standard personal weaponry is the Arbites combat [[shotgun]], [[boltgun]], [[grenade launcher]], [[suppression shield]] and the [[power maul]]. Several types of [[grenade]]s are used, both lethal and incapacitating. Some Patrol groups and [[Enforcer]]s may use [[Cyber-Mastiff]]s to hunt down and catch criminal fugitives who attempt to escape.{{Fn|4}}{{Fn|5}}

The Arbites also make use of a wide range of vehicles, such as [[Rhino]]s{{Fn|6a}}, [[Repressor]]s{{Fn|6b}}, [[Chimera]]s{{Fn|6c}}, [[Leman Russ Battle Tank]]s{{Fn|22}}, as well as aircraft like the [[Valkyrie]] and the [[Brawler T8]].
They also make use of [[Tarantula]] automated turrets for crowd control, riot suppression, and defending their precincts.{{Fn|9}}

The Arbites also maintain a small fleet of patrol craft and counter-insurgency vessels, most notably among these the [[Punisher Class Strike Cruiser]]. The Arbites fleet also operates logistical vessels, transports, and other support craft such as [[Prison Barge]]s.{{Fn|10}}

==Adeptus Arbites in Warhammer 40,000==
The Adeptus Arbites are one of the original components of the [[Warhammer 40,000]] universe (although undoubtedly inspired by Judge Dredd). In the [[Ordo Malleus]]/[[Grey Knights]] army list in [[Realm of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness]] Arbites squads could be used as an auxiliary force. In the basic Codex army lists included with [[Second Edition]], taken as allies from the &quot;Imperial Agents&quot; army list, they could be used as part of [[Space Marine]] and [[Imperial Guard]] armies. In [[Third Edition]] the Adeptus Arbites had an official army list (Citadel Journal 29). In [[Fourth Edition]] they appear only in Witch Hunter armies, represented by Inquisition [[Storm Trooper]]s using the option of replacing their [[Hellgun]]s with [[shotgun]]s. In [[Fifth Edition]] the best way to represent them remained the Witch Hunter army, until it was rewritten as [[Codex: Sisters of Battle]]. At the tail end of 5th and in [[Sixth Edition]] [[Codex: Grey Knights]] could be use Inquisitorial Henchman warbands, using Warrior Acolytes. The release of the Inquisitorial forces seperately meant that [[Codex: Inquisition]] could also be used. In [[Seventh Edition]], Inquisitors were removed from the Grey Knights and so the only way remains to use Inquisition. One could also use [[Codex: Astra Militarum]] [[Veterans]] with [[shotgun]]s and the grenadier doctrine, and the demolitions doctrine on some to represent breaching squads. This also gives the opportunity to use the rules of a [[Lord Commissar]] with [[power maul]] and [[carapace armour]] to represent Judges.

[[Image:Adeptus Astra Telepathica Symbol.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Symbol of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica{{Fn|9}}]]
The '''Adeptus Astra Telepathica''' is an organization of the [[Adeptus Terra]], responsible for the recruitment and training of [[psyker]]s into the service of the [[Imperium]].  The Adeptus Astra Telepathica trains the majority of Imperial psykers, which become known as [[Sanctioned Psyker]]s.

==Overview==
The Adeptus Astra Telepathica is divided into a recruitment body (the [[League of Blackships]]) and a training body (the [[Scholastia Psykana]]).  These two are united under the [[Master of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] and his advisory council of several hundred senior officials from the two divisions. They are responsible for the specially trained [[Astrotelepath]]s who use their mysterious powers to communicate with others of their kind across vast interstellar distances which separates the worlds of the Imperium.{{Fn|4}} The Astra Telepathica is also known to operate a special decryption and internal affairs branch known as the [[Cryptaesthesian]]s. During the [[Great Crusade]] the Astra Telepathica also operated a unit of [[Blank]] psyker-hunters who manned the Black Ships known as the ''Departmento Investigates'', otherwise known as the [[Sisters of Silence]]. The numbers of the Silent Sisterhood dwindled as a result of the [[Horus Heresy]] but active units have been observed at the end of the [[41st Millennium]].{{Fn|12}}

Their ranks consist of psychic servants of the Imperium and these psykers have undergone the [[Soul Binding]] ritual with the [[Emperor]].  This process passes on some of the Emperor's strength of will into his servants, thus protecting them from evil, psychically attuned enemies.  The ritual ultimately results in blindness though there are a rare few Astropaths who are judged strong enough to warrant them not taking part in the Soul Binding.  These individuals are considered the lucky ones, as they do not have to partake in the agonising process as most Astropaths.{{Fn|5}} 

It is through the righteous persecution of the [[Inquisition]], combined with the careful testing of the '''Coven Masters''' of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica which purges any deviant mutations that are commonly associated with those beings that develop psychic potential.{{Fn|1a}} Under Imperial edict, the Adeptus Astra Telepathica are allowed their own operatives but they were prohibited from serving as wardens aboard their own vessels.  This is because it was far too easy for a malignant psyker to coerce the mind of another telepath. Thus, they used the [[Sisters of Battle]] or [[Inquisitorial]] [[Storm Troopers]] to serve as custodians aboard the Black Ships where their faith protected them from the predations of the mind-witches they guarded.{{Fn|Conflicting Sources}} Meanwhile, highly trained [[Black Sentinels]] were used to guard important Telepathica facilities.{{Fn|3}}{{Fn|15}}

Before the end of the [[Horus Heresy]], this division within the Imperium held the '''[[City of Sight]]''' as its headquarters where psykers were taken to its mindhalls for testing.  Inside these iron clad halls, the psykers took their first steps in the soul binding ritual and further recruitment into the astropathic choirs.{{Fn|2}} Today, palace complex of Astra Telepathica is called [[Obsidian Keep]]{{Fn|13}}, though it is unknown if this is simply part of the City of Sight or a new location entirely.

Due to their duties, the Adeptus Astra Telepathica works in conjunction with the [[Adeptus Astronomica]].{{Fn|4}} Much of the strange properties of the warp remained a mystery to the research theologians of this organisation.{{Fn|2}}

==History==
[[Image:Telepathica.jpg|thumb|right|An Adept of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica{{Fn|1c}}]]
The Adeptus Astra Telepathica was first formed by the [[Emperor]] in preparation for the [[Great Crusade]].  Constructing the massive [[Astronomican]], the Astra Telepathica was at this time mandated by the Emperor to maintain and run the massive machine (though this duty has since fallen to the [[Adeptus Astronomica]]).  Thus the Astra Telepathica played a key role in the [[Great Crusade]], as without their psychic light humanity could have never been unified.  In addition, the Astra Telepathica was instrumental in rounding up the rogue psykers and &quot;Witch-Kings&quot; which had plagued Terra since the [[Age of Strife]].{{Fn|8}}

At the time of the Great Crusade, the Adeptus Astra Telepathica had a militant arm - the [[Sisters of Silence]] - who manned the blackships and searched for emerging psykers. An additional force known as the [[Black Sentinels]] provided security for Astropathic facilities in the [[Sol System]].{{Fn|10}} After the Horus Heresy the Sisters of Silence largely died out as an order save their role as guardians of the Black Ships, though a single fortress of Sisters of Silence was encountered by the Imperium during the [[War of the Beast]]. Since the beginning of the [[Indomitus Crusade]], the Sisters of Silence have been fully restored by order of [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|11}}{{Fn|16}}

During [[Goge Vandire]]'s [[Reign of Blood]], he quickly ascended to total control of the Imperium.  However, he was unable to gain control of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, since its [[Master of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica|Master]], Lord [[Phaedrus]], was a potent psyker and thus not swayed by Vandire's charisma.  This allowed Phaedrus to see through Vandire's deceit and machinations.  This was troublesome for Vandire, who was used to staying one step ahead of his opponents.  Assassinating Phaedrus would not solve the problem, since Phaedrus's successor would likely be an equally powerful psyker.  Instead, Vandire used a [[Culexus]] [[Assassin]] to rob the psyker of his abilities whilst using a life support system to keep him alive.  Robbed of his power and prevented from killing himself, Lord Phaedrus agreed to follow Goge Vandire on the condition that the loss of his psychic abilities be kept secret.  Thus was Vandire able to subvert the Adeptus Astra Telepathica.{{Fn|6}}

In the [[Age of the Imperium]], the destruction of the planet [[Tyran]] led to the growing discovery of the extragalactic aliens that became known as the [[Tyranid]]s.  Among the mounting evidence being assembled included scraps of tissue from the [[Thandros]] Telepathica Matrix.{{Fn|1b}} Following the re-emergence of the world of [[Toreus]] after it was engulfed in a Warp rift, a team of archeodiviners were dispatched to the planet where they were overwhelmed by the Chaotic taint who all died from exposure to it.{{Fn|7}}

Following the creation of the [[Great Rift]] the light of the [[Astronomican]] temporarily went out and a scream of [[Chaos]] enveloped much of the galaxy. In the ensuing mayhem known as [[The Blackness]], enormous numbers of Astropaths went mad.{{Fn|14}}

=={{Endn|Conflicting Sources}}==
While older lore stated that Inquisitorial Stormtroopers and Sisters of Battle were used to guard the Black Ships after the Horus Heresy, recent sources state the Sisters of Silence never lost their custodianship of the vessels.{{Fn|3}}{{Fn|16}}

 [[Image:Adeptus Astronomica Symbol.jpg|thumb|90px|right|Symbol of the Adeptus Astronomica{{Fn|3}}]]
The '''Adeptus Astronomica''' are members of the [[Imperial]] [[Adeptus Terra]] who maintain the [[psychic]] beacon known as the [[Astronomican]], used by [[Navigators]].{{Fn|2a}}

==Duties==
The Astronomica works closely with the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] and recruits from their ranks.{{Fn|1}}

The Adeptus Astronomica is largely composed of [[psyker]]s; its non-psykers are hereditary servants. The process of constantly transmitting mental energy ultimately destroys these psykers, though there are always more to take their place.{{Fn|2a}} This act, however, allows Imperial ships to travel through the perils of the [[warp]] at great speeds.{{Fn|2b}} The organization is based in Terra's [[Forbidden Fortress]], where even [[Judge]]s and [[Inquisitors]] must receive invitation to enter. The task of the Adeptus Astronomica is to train the young psykers they receive from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, so that they can serve in the [[Chamber of the Astronomican]]. The whole organisation is basically a training institute run by a class of older members known as Instructors. Some of the Instructors are given the title High Instructor and given control of a certain area of teaching. The day to day tasks such as maintenance are taken care of by a body of administrative functionaries.{{Cite This}}

==Organization &amp; Recruitment==
The overall head of the Adeptus Astronomica is the [[Master of the Astronomican]], who represents the organization as a [[High Lord of Terra]]. In terms of composition, the organisation has an administrative elite along with a large pool of young trainees who will one day become part of the corps of ten thousand that power the Astronomican. These trainees are taught to release their psychic potential by way of mental exercises which is a process that takes a few months. Afterwards, they are called into the psychic battery in the Hall of the Astronomicon and can be called at any time as old members either die or fail. In this state, the trainees rarely last more than two or three months with a hundred dying every day whilst within the spherical chamber. This process sees their very lifeforce being slowly drained away by strange apparatus at the focal point of the great spherical hall. Though these individuals sadly give their lives away, it is the ultimate sacrifice needed for Humanity's continued survival. Due to their duties, members of the Adeptus Astronomica are rarely seen off [[Terra]] though its leaders who are responsible for the continued use of the Astronomican are allowed to travel freely. Similar to the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]], this organisation is a monastic order and its members wear clothing similar to religious devotees, which are blue and hooded. Those fully trained members have their heads shaven and are ready to receive the neural implants which will one day drain their lifeforce to power the Astronomican.{{Fn|2c}}

Young psykers are initiated into the Astronomica as Acolytes. They are taught not just how to use and control their psychic powers but are introduced to the ''Lore of the Astronomican''. They learn the value of their lives, study philosophy and are gradually brought to an inner understanding of the universe and the nature of the warp. Those who achieve this mystic state become the '''Chosen''' and are eventually called to serve in the Chamber of the Astronomican. The status of Chosen is considered a great honour. To fall short of attaining this goal is not a failure; rather they go on to become Instructors or are absorbed as administrative functionaries in the [[Forbidden Fortress]]. Those who do make it to Chosen status, often [[Space Marine]] [[Librarian]]s or [[Sanctioned Psyker]]s of the [[Imperial Guard]]{{Fn|4}} are considered above the Instructors and even the Master of the Astronomican. Their heads are shaven and they wear yellow robes and the scarlet badge of the Chosen. The rest of their lives are spent in prayer and contemplation until they are called to serve in the Chamber of the Astronomican.{{Cite This}} Like the Psykers sacrificed before the Throne, the Chosen are in time killed in service to the Emperor.{{Fn|4}}

The '''Adeptus Mechanicus''', also formerly known as the '''Mechanicum''', is a technological organisation, often known as the ''Priesthood of [[Mars]]''. It holds a monopoly on technological knowledge in the [[Imperium]]. Their [[Forge World]]s turn out the Imperium's most powerful and advanced weaponry and equipment. The organisation's adepts, the [[Tech-priest]]s, are vital in maintaining much of the Imperium's more technologically advanced equipment, not the least of which is the [[Emperor]]'s life-sustaining [[Golden Throne]].{{Fn|1}}

== Overview ==
While the Adeptus Mechanicus is a part of the Imperium, it has developed separately and enjoys a considerable degree of independence. Due to the great amount of power it wields, the Adeptus Mechanicus could almost be compared to be like an allied empire, rather than an organisation within the Imperium. The Adeptus Mechanicus also follows a different religion from the rest of the Imperium. The religion and religious structure of the Adeptus Mechanicus is known as the [[Cult Mechanicus]]. The symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus is a skull, half-bone and half-machine, set against the background of a black and white cog.{{Fn|1}}

[[Adept]]s of the Adeptus Mechanicus are known as tech-priests. Any member of the Cult Mechanicus over the rank of menial will often be referred to as a tech-priest, though Magi and higher ranks are usually referred to by rank. As befits the religious nature of the Mechanicus, tech-priests usually wear robes, which are usually either rust-red or white. Tech-priests are often [[Imperial bionics|cybernetically augmented]]. The level of a techpriest's augmentation is highly dependent on his rank within the [[Cult Mechanicus]]; a novice may have only one or two augmented systems, if any, while very senior members may have only a few biological organs left in their bodies.{{Fn|1}}

Members of the Mechanicum are often fast-grown in vats, infused with a instinctual level of knowledge due to data uplinks during their gestation. They are then born already post-adolescence and are promptly put to work{{Fn|24}}. Members can also come from [[Imperials]], who have been converted by the [[Sect Missionarius Mechanicus]]{{Fn|41c}} and even the [[Squat]] [[Abhuman]] subspecies.{{Fn|42}}
==Origins and history==
===Early history===
[[Image:TechPriestArtNew.jpg|thumb|right|A '''Techpriest'''.]]
The birthplace of the Martian Mechanicum was the ancient Forge World Mars. Mars was colonised early in human history, and developed separately from [[Terra]], both culturally and technologically. The arid surface of Mars was terraformed, and under a man-made atmosphere the colony flourished.{{Fn|1}}

During the [[Dark Age of Technology]], the two empires of Terra and Mars co-existed, to the mutual benefit of both. At the height of its splendour during the Golden Age, and even later in the anarchic [[Age of Strife]], Mars dispatched hundreds of colony fleets into the void. Many perished in the terrible [[Warp storm]]s that engulfed the [[galaxy]] at that time, but others survived. Those that did founded new worlds in the name of the Machine God, building on them a likeness of the great factories and temples of their distant home world. The Age of Strife brought an end to the glory and peace of the [[human]] domains. Across the galaxy mankind suddenly turned upon itself as a new breed of Warp-attuned humans emerged. Civil war engulfed thousands of human worlds, including the twin empires of Terra and Mars.{{Cite This}}

Because of lack of maintenance during this time, Mars's atmospheric radiation shields soon disintegrated, allowing deadly solar radiation to destroy the fragile ecosystem and wiping out sparse vegetation which had taken millennia to cultivate. Mars returned to being the red wasteland of the past. Plagues caused by high radiation levels slew most of the population. Many of the survivors devolved into [[mutant]]s or gibbering cannibals. The destruction of the entire planet seemed likely. However, this was not to be, for a new idea began to spread among the people, a religion of survival - the Cult Mechanicus dedicated to the Machine God. The religious devotees sought out the now scattered technology needed to rebuild temporary radiation shelters. The cult demanded absolute devotion from its followers, for only by selfless dedication and often personal sacrifice could machines be recovered or the planet saved. Under the direction of their Tech-priest leaders, the cultists set about restoring order to the world. They built shelters to protect themselves from the radiation storms, and oxygen generators and food processing machines to enable them to live behind the enclosed shielding.{{Cite This}}

There were few shelters even for the Tech-priests and none for unbelievers. Marauders and mutant raiders tried to force their way inside the hurriedly constructed buildings. Many of the cultists died defending their shelters and some early shelters were destroyed, but the survivors emerged all the stronger and more determined. The people interpreted their survival in the face of tremendous odds as vindication of the Cult Mechanicus. Their resolve and devotion to the cult became unshakable. While rival warlords battled over the remnants of Terra the Tech-priests built Mars anew, and the first temples of the Machine God were built. The Tech-priests scoured the ruins of Mars for surviving machinery which they enshrined within the Temple of All Knowledge. Within the temple's plasteel shell shining pistons held the vaulted roof almost a mile above. The shafts of each piston were so constructed that they moved to raise and lower the roof, altering its acoustic properties to accentuate the hymns of praise sung to the Machine God. The High Altar within took the form of a vast database containing the whole knowledge of the Tech-priests. Even today every new discovery is dedicated to this altar. Every temple on Mars and throughout the Forge Worlds is connected to the High Altar by means of a living Transmat link, a psychic [[Servitor]] whose mind co-joins all altars of the Cult Mechanicus into one holy machine entity.{{Fn|2}}

Now unified under the Cult Mechanicus, the Priesthood of Mars began to dispatch [[Explorator Fleet]]s across the galaxy and even plundered the surface of war-torn [[Terra]] itself in hopes of discovering lost technologies. Facing resistance to their quest on the planet's surface, the Adeptus Mechanicus soon became bitter enemies with the [[Techno-barbarian]]s which plagued Terra and thus welcomed the eventual arrival of the [[Emperor]].{{Fn|6}}

===Union with the Imperium===
[[Image:MechBattle8th.jpg|thumb|right|The Adeptus Mechanicus at war{{Fn|10a}}]]
*{{Main|Treaty of Olympus}}
After the Emperor formed the [[Imperium]], he engendered support with the Martian Mechanicum, an already existing empire. On Mars, he was commonly seen as the [[Omnissiah]], the earthly representative of the Machine God, due to his ability to seemingly instantly repair machinery with a mere touch. After landing in a golden ship on Mars' surface The Emperor came before the [[Mechanicum Parliament]] on Mars, pledging that in return for supply arms to his armies and building a mighty war fleet, the Emperor would protect and the respect the sovereignty of the Mechanicum's [[Forge World]]s. In addition, he would donate six [[Navigator]] Houses to Mars, whose supply of Navigator's had since dwindled. Given such incentives the [[Martian Parliament]] and [[Fabricator-General]] agreed to the terms, and the formal alliance between the Adeptus Mechanicus and Imperium was signed on [[Terra]] between the Martian Ambassador and the Emperor.{{Fn|6}}

The Treaty was not celebrated by all of the Tech-Priest elements on Mars. Many Tech-Priests saw the Emperor as a warlord seeking to subordinate the Mechanicum and limit their technological research. Among these was [[Kelbor-Hal]].{{Fn|4}}

===Horus Heresy===
During the [[Horus Heresy]], the Mechanicum like most other branches of the Imperial military, found itself divided in loyalty. Many Mechanicum units declared for the [[Warmaster]] [[Horus]], some retained their loyalty to the Imperium and some seceded altogether to remain neutral during the conflict.{{Fn|38}}

Horus was able to convince the [[Fabricator-General]] himself, [[Kelbor-Hal]], to join forces with him on the condition that the autonomy of the Mechanicum be ensured, and that the STCs the [[Sons of Horus]] had captured from the recently subjugated but technologically advanced [[Auretian Technocracy]] be handed over to him. Kelbor-Hal's deputy, the [[Fabricator Locum]] [[Kane]], remained loyal to the Emperor however, which initiated a civil war on the Red Planet known as the [[Schism of Mars]] that mirrored the larger conflict raging across the galaxy.{{Fn|4}}

The Mechanicum considered the division of the Mechanicum with Hal and Kane both claiming the title of Fabricator General an unresolved equation, known as the &quot;binary succession&quot;. In an attempt to resolve this, Ambassador [[Vethorel]], Fabricator General Kane's representative on the [[Council of Terra]], proposed to resolve this by the creation of a new Adeptus, the '''Adeptus Mechanicus'''. Despite the Mechanicum's concerns for their independence and the council's fears of a Martian power-grab, the resolution passed after the [[Collegia Titanica]] threatened to abandon the [[Solar War]] and the [[Imperator Titan]] ''Magnificum Incendius'' of the [[Legio Ignatum]] marched on the [[Great Chamber of the Senatorum Imperialis]].{{fn|9}}

The Mechanicum units that fought against the Emperor would come to be known in later times as the [[Dark Mechanicum]].{{Cite This}}

===Post-Heresy===
In the last 10,000 years since the Great Heresy, the Adeptus Mechanicus has become fanatically ingrained in the dogma of the [[Cult Mechanicus]]. As their [[Forge World]]s supply mankind with vital weaponry and technology, the Adeptus Mechanicus continues their [[Quest for Knowledge]] and vigorously hunt for remains of precious [[STC]]s. Major conflicts over the tenets of the Cult Mechanicus have plagued the Adeptus Mechanicus, most notable of which include the [[Moirae Schism]], [[North-South Mars Conflict|Martian Civil War]], and [[Elucidan Schism]].{{Fn|7}}

However, over the millennia, the ability of the Adeptus Mechanicus to reproduce technology from the [[Great Crusade]] has gradually diminished. Even the [[Golden Throne]], cornerstone of the Imperium, is proving beyond the ability of the Adeptus Mechanicus to repair and maintain.{{Fn|8}}

===Dark Imperium===
With the creation of the [[Great Rift]], many worlds of the Mechanicum became stranded within the [[Dark Imperium]]. Other worlds were using isolation as a pretext to declare independence. Faced with crisis, the core Forge Worlds of the Adeptus Mechanicus organized reclamation fleets to reestablish contact with these lost worlds and remind them of their duty to Mars.{{Fn|37}}

==Beliefs==
===Cult Mechanicus===
[[Image:Techpriests.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Techpriests''' performing their rituals{{Fn|39}}]]
*{{Main|Cult Mechanicus}}
Although the Emperor is venerated by the Adeptus Mechanicus for his ancient knowledge and comprehension, the techpriests do not follow the [[Imperial Cult]], but a wholly different religion, known as the Cult Mechanicus or the Cult of the Machine.{{Fn|1}}

The Cult Mechanicus originated during the Age of Strife. According to its teachings, knowledge is the supreme manifestation of divinity, and all creatures and artefacts that embody knowledge are holy because of it. Machines that preserve knowledge from ancient times are also holy, and machine intelligences are no less divine than those of flesh and blood. A man's worth is only the sum of his knowledge - his body is simply an organic machine capable of preserving intellect. In the Cult's tenets, life itself is of no intrinsic value. One of the most obvious examples of this belief is the techpriests' use of humans as raw material in the creation of the machine-slaves known as servitors.{{Fn|3}}

To the Cult Mechanicus, machines represent a higher form of life than that created through biological evolution. The ultimate object of the cult's veneration is known as the Machine God (or the ''Deus Mechanicus''), which is believed to have given rise to all technologies and made them manifest through his chosen illuminati among mankind. The Machine God may be the [[C'tan]] [[Mag'ladroth|Void Dragon]], who may be the [[Dragon of Mars]] that has been entombed on Mars for millennia and was worshipped by the Cult Mechanicus before the rise of the Emperor.{{Fn|1}}

The Cult Mechanicus await the arrival of the Omnissiah, a prophesied physical avatar of the Machine God. During the Great Crusade the forces of the Emperor liberated many of the forge worlds founded as colonies of Mars in ancient times. On his arrival at many of the worlds, the Cult Mechanicus recognised the Emperor as the long awaited Omnissiah.{{Fn|1}}

The sacred number of Adeptus Mechanicus - is a 12. So each ''macroclade'' of this organization is composed of four ''cohorts'', each consisting of three ''maniples'' (12 maniples in total).{{Fn|10}}

===The Quest for Knowledge===
'''The Quest for Knowledge''' is the driving mission of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The quest consists of research and exploration, but ultimately the focus of the quest is on the recovery of a working  [[Standard Template Construct]] (&quot;STC&quot;) system. The purpose of the many exploratory missions is the recovery of STC knowledge.{{Fn|1}}

For thousands of years the Tech-priests have pursued all information about the STC. To the Mechanicus, it is their lost bible. Any information on the STC including the scraps of knowledge recorded on hard copy designs are sought out and kept as holy texts. No functional STC systems have ever been recovered. The STC survives only as print-outs, some of which are many thousands of years old. Although considered the most reliable, there are very few first generation print-outs, and these are regarded as the most sacred of texts.{{Fn|1}}

Through the Tech-priests' efforts much has been recovered or reconstructed through comparison of copies, although preserved knowledge of the most advanced technology eludes the Adeptus Mechanicus. Most of the early colonists' needs were simple and very few would have bothered to preserve the more theoretical and advanced technological information the STC contained.{{Fn|1}}

===Factions===
{{Fanatic}}

Like the [[Inquisition]] and the [[Ecclesiarchy]], the Adeptus Mechanicus has a number of philosophical factions within it which dictate an individuals pursuit of the Quest for Knowledge.{{Fn|25}}  These factions include:

*[[Aes Omnissiah]]- A secret sect experimenting with the purity of form in the [[Lathe Worlds]].{{Fn|27d}}
*[[Alium Union]]- Believe that those who toil can serve the Quest for Knowledge as well as the high profile adepts.{{Fn|27b}}  
*[[Carnicula]]- Split from the Hippocrasian Sect to study controversial life-extending techniques, aligned with the Organicists.{{Fn|27d}}  
*[[Crucible Resolviate]]- Study and research Xenos machine spirits.{{Fn|28}}
*[[Cult Achanum]]- Believers that the Omnissiah has a pre-ordained plan.{{Fn|27b}}  
*[[Disciples of Thule]]- Belief in the importance of seeking knowledge of the past in the field.{{Fn|27a}} 
*[[Divine Light of Sollex]]- Focuses their attention on developing more and more powerful weaponry.{{Fn|27b}} 
*[[Ferrous Whisper]]- A radical sect who want to see the Mechanicus as independent from, but still allied to, the Imperium.{{Fn|27c}} 
*[[Hippocrasian Sect]]- Study the transition between life and death.{{Fn|27c}} 
*[[Imperio-Cognisticians]]- A traditionalist faction who see the galaxy as full of corrupted programming.{{Fn|25}} 
*[[Khamrians]]- A radical faction interested in [[Abominable Intelligence]].{{Fn|25}} 
*[[Levelists]]- A radical faction who believe technology should be the preserve of all mankind, not just the Adeptus Mechanicus.{{Fn|27c}} 
*[[Magos Fidelis]]- A conservative faction concerned with the disunity in the Lathe Worlds.{{Fn|27b}} 
*[[Moirae Schism|Moirae Tech-creed]]- A creed based on prophetic calculations in the rebellious Forge World of Moirae.{{Fn|35}} 
*[[Omnissiads]]- A radical faction looking to summon the Omnissiah into an Avatar.{{Fn|25}} 
*[[Organicists]]- A faction who see flesh as a machine, and upgrade themselves with lab-grown enhancements.{{Fn|25}} 
*[[Scions of the Iron Sphere]]- See flesh as holding back mankind from its true potential.{{Fn|27c}} 
*[[Tenninites]]- A faction interested in better understanding of [[machine spirit]]s.{{Fn|27d}}  
*[[Xenarite]]s- A radical faction who focus on studying and using alien technology.{{Fn|26}}

===[[Hereteks]]===
Among the Mechanicus, there are those factions who have been declared hereteks for deviating too far from the teachings of the Mechanicus
*[[Acolyte of Abraxas|Acolytes of Abraxas]]- A heretek group who seek to learn the secrets of warp-based Xenos technology and incorporate it into their own bionics.{{Fn|29}}
*[[Empyric Engineers]]- A heretek faction who employ [[warp]] technology.{{Fn|30}}
*[[Logicians]]- A heretek faction who believe in throwing off the constrains of Imperial institutions such as the Ecclesiarchy for the advancement of mankind.{{Fn|31}} 
*[[Lubricae Cult]]- A heretek group who worship lubricant.{{Fn|32}} 
*[[Negavolt Cultists]]- Hereteks who use [[daemonic]] inovacations and rituals.{{Fn|34}} 
*[[Schismaticals of the Deep Infotombs]]- A heretek group who seek to use forbidden data spirits known as schismaticals.{{Fn|33}} 
*[[Xarisians]]- An extinct heretek subsect of the Moirae creed who indulged in rampant techno-heresy.{{Fn|36}}

==Language==
{{main|Cant Mechanicus}}
[[Lingua-technis]] or Techna-Lingua is the official language of the Adeptus Mechanicus and part of the collective [[Cant Mechanicus]]. It is a binary language, optimised for quick communication of technical data, which consists of a burst of static emitted through the bionic implants of members of the Mechanicum which cannot be understood by unaugmented humans.{{Fn|4}}
[[Image:MechForces.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Forces of the Adeptus Mechanicus{{Fn|10}}]]

==Organisation==
[[Image:AdMechHierarchy.jpg|thumb|right|Adeptus Mechanicus Hierarchy{{Fn|7}}]]
The Adeptus Mechanicus is internally organized along a feudal structure, with lesser domains owing allegiance to major [[Forge World]]s, who in turn have sworn fealty to the [[Fabricator-General]] of [[Mars]]. This feudal hierarchy extends to their military forces, with each Forge World being responsible for raising and maintaining their own forces for the service of the greater Mechanicum.{{Fn|14}} Many Forge Worlds oversee their own petty empires.{{Fn|40}}

===Adeptus Mechanicus Fleet===
*{{Main|Basilikon Astra}}

Because the '''Quest for Knowledge''' can involve long, ardurous forays into unexplored space; the Adeptus Mechanicus have at their disposal a large fleet of starships. It is important that these vessels be heavily armed and armoured, not only for their own protection from those who covet their technology but to engage in combat when necessary to secure vital data or artefacts that may prove cruical to the Quest. Though the total number of ships the Adeptus Mechanicus has at its disposal dispersed among its many forge worlds is far outnumbered by that of the Imperial Navy, it goes without saying that those responsible for all starship construction reserve for themselves among the most powerful and best-equipped warships encountered anywhere in the Imperium.{{citethis}}

Mechanicus fleets have access to the same types of vessel as the [[Imperial Fleet]], as well as other unique vessels such as the near-legendary [[Ark Mechanicus]].{{Fn|5}}

[[Image:AdeptusTerraSymbol.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of the Adeptus Terra]]
The '''Adeptus Terra''', also known as the '''Priesthood of [[Earth]]''', is the central organisation of the [[Imperium]], to which most of the Imperium's other official departments and organisations belong.  Only the [[Ecclesiarchy]], [[Adeptus Mechanicus]],{{Fn|1}} and the [[Inquisition]] are not formally a part of the Adeptus Terra, while the [[Space Marines]] are only loosely affiliated{{Fn|1}}. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:ImpHierarchy.png|right|thumb|300px|Organisation of the Imperial government.{{Fn|1}}]]

The Adeptus Terra is an umbrella organisation, and not really an organisation in itself, as each of its divisions functions largely autonomously.  The most powerful individual in the Adeptus Terra (and if not in theory, then in practice, the entire Imperium) is the [[Master of the Administratum]].{{Fn|1}}

Membership to any of the various agencies of the Adeptus Terra is coveted by many of the commoners of the Imperium seeking to obtain a better life for both themselves and their families as even low-level membership comes with it exclusive privileges not given to normal Imperial citizens.{{Fn|2}} At the same time the Priesthood is viewed with a large amount of fear and suspicion by the Imperial populace, who pray it will never infringe upon their lives or their worlds. The gaze of the Adeptus Terra often carries with it the chance of being swept up in endless wars or liquidated in pogroms instituted by overly zealous bureaucrats.{{Fn|3}}

===Organization===
The following are all formally part of the Adeptus Terra{{Fn|1}}

'''The Age of Rebirth''' was the time that followed the events of the disastrous [[Horus Heresy]]. It is the first era of the [[Age of the Imperium]]. The damage to the [[Imperium]] was slowly repaired and its military forces reformed to secure safety. Eventually, it was not a military conflict that would revive unrest but a massive assassination attempt.{{Fn|1}}

==Events==
===The Great Scouring (.M31)===
{{Main|Great Scouring}}
The Imperium survived the [[Horus Heresy]], but only just. With the [[Emperor]] confined to the [[Golden Throne]] it was leaderless and the Followers of [[Chaos]] were still spread throughout the galaxy. A campaign of vengeance was started to reclaim lost territories, driving the forces of the traitors into the [[Eye of Terror]] and reestablishing stability.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|2}}

===The Codex Astartes===
{{Main|Codex Astartes}}
Various doctrines and edicts were drawn up to prevent a large-scale military rebellion such as the Horus Heresy from ever happening again. The most notable of them was the Codex Astartes which split the remaining [[Space Marine Legion]]s into smaller, more numerous [[Chapter]]s.{{Fn|1}}

===The Beast (544.M32)===
{{Main|War of the Beast}}
In 544.[[M32]] an [[Ork]] [[Warboss]] known only as [[The Beast]] united much of the Ork race and nearly succeeded in conquering the [[Galaxy]]. His [[Waaagh!]] was the largest the Galaxy has ever seen and rampaged across the [[Imperium]]. The Imperium only halted his advance at great cost and desperate measure, devastating the [[Adeptus Astartes]].{{Fn|3}}

===The Beheading (546.M32)===
{{Main|The Beheading}}
[[Drakan Vangorich]], [[Grand Master of Assassins|Grand Master]] of the [[Officio Assassinorum]] initiated the deaths of the [[High Lords of Terra]] and in return was slain by the single survivor of a retribution force drawn from the [[Halo Brethren]], [[Imperial Fists]] and [[Sable Swords]] [[Chapter]]s. In the aftermath, the [[Imperium]] descended into anarchy.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Age of Redemption''' is a period in the history of the [[Imperium]] starting at roughly 020.[[M37]] and ending at 034.[[M38]].{{Fn|1}} It followed the catastrophic period in Imperial history known as the [[Age of Apostasy]].{{Fn|1}}

===Overview===
The Age of Redemption was a period of fierce religious fervor in the Imperium. The [[Imperial Cult]] grew in power as never before and enormous numbers of suspected Heretics were rounded up and executed. [[Crusade]] after Crusade was launched to recapture the squandered wealth of the Imperium lost in the Age of Apostasy. However as the fervor peaked and these many [[wars of faith]] were launched, large numbers of worlds were left with inadequate defenses and [[Imperial Guard Regiment]]s and [[Space Marine Chapter]]s were increasingly drawn into longer and more terrible crusades. The result would be a period known as [[The Waning]] in which the military forces of the Imperium, exhausted by long Crusades, found themselves unable to defend against the encroachment of [[Orks]], [[Chaos]] insurgencies, and internal strife.{{Fn|1}}

==Notable Events==
*??? - The [[Benedictine War]]
*020.[[M37]] '''The Great Cull:''' The [[High Lords of Terra]] order a systematic extermination of large numbers of Imperial worlds suspected of heresy.{{Fn|1}}
*321.[[M37]] '''The [[Abyssal Crusade]]:''' [[Saint Basillius]] declares that 30 [[Space Marine Chapter]]s are found wanting in the eyes of the [[Emperor]]. The Space Marines concerned embark on a penitent Crusade into the [[Eye of Terror]] to cleanse the worlds consumed by the birth of [[Slaanesh]].{{Fn|3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7468">{{AgesMankind}}
The '''Age of the Imperium''' is one of the ages in the history of [[Human|mankind]]. It began c.[[M30]] and continues to this day.{{Fn|1}} {{Fn|2}}

==Early History==
===Rise of the Emperor===
{{main|Age of Strife}} 
During the '''Age of Strife''' [[Warp storm]]s had separated [[Terra]] from its colonies and plunged disparate [[human]] civilisations across the galaxy into disarray and chaos.  When the storms abated, a new powerful leader called the [[Emperor of Mankind]] emerged.  He conquered Terra and entered an alliance with the [[Mechanicum]] on [[Mars]].  With his [[Legion]]s of genetically engineered [[Space Marine]]s, he planned to reunite mankind.{{Fn|2a}}

===The Great Crusade (c.M31)===
{{main|Great Crusade}} 
[[Image:Lunawolveslegion.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Space Marines of old during the '''Great Crusade''']]
'''The Great Crusade''' lasted 200 years and brought many long-lost systems into the fold of the [[Imperium]].  Under the [[War Council]] of the Emperor and his [[Primarchs]], vast [[Expedition Fleet]]s of the [[Imperial Army]] and Space Marine Legions fought back [[Xenos|aliens]] and [[warp]]-tainted forces that had gained a foothold in the domain of man during the Age of Strife.{{Fn|2a}} 

===Horus Heresy (c.M31)===
{{main|Horus Heresy}}
The Great Crusade ended with the '''Horus Heresy'''.  [[Horus]], greatest among the Primarchs and the favoured son of the Emperor, fell under the influence of the [[Gods of Chaos]].  In an attempt to usurp his creator and take his place as Emperor of Mankind, he took control of a full third of the whole Imperium's armed forces, including half of the Space Marine Legions) and marched towards Terra.  He was ultimately slain, but the Emperor was mortally wounded and the Imperium left at the brink of collapse.{{Fn|1}} {{Fn|2}} 

==Ages of the Imperium==
{{AgesImperium}}
===The Age of Rebirth (c.M31 - c.M32)===
{{main|Age of Rebirth}}
During the '''Age of Rebirth''' the Imperium slowly recovered from the Horus Heresy.{{Fn|1}}

The wars of the [[Great Scouring]] were fought in the decades after the Horus' demise.  In a lengthy campaign the Imperium hunted and banished the remaining traitors from their realm.  Eventually the followers of Chaos found refuge in the [[Eye of Terror]].{{Fn|3}} At the same time many alien races that had been fought back during the Great Crusade reappeared and plagued the vulnerable worlds of man.{{Fn|2b}} One of the greatest renewed threats to mankind was that of the [[Ork]], which nearly reunified as a race under a [[Warboss]] known only as [[The Beast]]. His [[War of the Beast|Waaagh!]] was halted only at great cost.

In order to prevent a single person from controlling as much military power as Horus did and thus eliminating the risk of another large scale military rebellion, numerous reforms were drawn up.  The [[Imperial Army]]'s link to the [[Imperial Fleet]] was severed, creating two separate forces, the [[Imperial Guard]] and [[Imperial Navy|Navy]].  The remaining loyal Space Marine Legions adopted the [[Codex Astartes]] written by Primarch [[Roboute Guilliman]] and were split into several smaller [[Chapter]]s.{{Fn|1}} {{Fn|4}}

===The Forging===
{{main|The Forging}}
'''The Forging''' is also known as the '''Golden Age of the Imperium'''.

During this period the [[Adeptus Terra]] brought the most important systems under its control and expanded the borders of the Imperium.  Internal stability was gained with the establishment of [[Astropathic Choir]]s on countless worlds and the discovery of valuable [[STC]]s from the Dark Age of Technology.

Once more the Imperium expunged the forces of [[Chaos]] and [[Xenos]] alike in the galaxy and reclaimed lost regions.{{Fn|1}}

===The Nova Terra Interregnum===
{{main|Nova Terra Interregnum}}
'''The Nova Terra Interregnum''' is also known as the time of twin Empires and lasted for 9 centuries.

The [[Ur-Council]] of [[Nova Terra]] dismissed the authority of the [[High Lords of Terra]] and claimed rule of the [[Segmentum Pacificus]].  

During the '''Cataclysm of Souls''' in 975.[[M35]] the [[Ecclesiarchy]] tried to unite the [[Imperium]] as a religious state.  Their efforts ended in massive religious wars against the Ur-Council.{{Fn|1}}

===The Age of Apostasy (M36)===
{{main|Age of Apostasy}}
'''The Age of Apostasy''' is renowned for the '''Reign of Blood''', the time of [[Goge Vandire]]'s dual rule as [[Ecclesiarch]] and [[Master of the Administratum]].  Vandire plunged the Imperium into a civil war that lasted for seven decades.{{Fn|1}}

===The Age of Redemption===
{{main|Age of Redemption}}
Beginning with the '''Great Cull''' by the [[High Lords of Terra]], thousands of worlds glowed with the pyres of heretics burning.  The [[Imperial Cult]] grew in power as never before, as those who defied the [[Ecclesiarchy]] were purged in blood and tears.{{Fn|1}}

A multitude of crusades were launched to recapture the squandered wealth of the [[Imperium]].  [[Living Saint|Saint]] [[Basillius]] judged that thirty Space Marine Chapters were found wanting and they embarked on a [[Abyssal Crusade|crusade]] into the [[Eye of Terror]], intent on purging those worlds stolen by the birth of [[Slaanesh]].{{Fn|1}}

At the height of this fervour thousands of worlds were left inadequately defended as sector fleets, [[Imperial Guard Regiment]]s, and Space Marine chapters were sent on increasingly longer and more terrible crusades.{{Fn|1}}

===The Waning===
{{main|The Waning}}
With the Imperium's military resources exhausted due to the religious crusades during the Age of Redemption, [[Ork]] and Chaos forces were able to overwhelm many planets and systems.  More and more Space Marine Chapters were granted control over systems in order to retain stability.{{Fn|1}}

===The Time of Ending (c750-999.M41)===
{{main|Time of Ending}}
These are the closing years of the 41st millennium.

The galaxy has become an increasingly hostile place and the realm of the Imperium has begun to crumble.  The light of the [[Astronomican]] is fading and the [[Golden Throne]] upon which the Emperor has rested for ten millennia has been discovered to have irreparable failures.{{Fn|1}}

By the end of the 41st Millennium, the Imperium was thrown into great turmoil as multiple disasters erupt. [[Cadia]] was destroyed by the [[Thirteenth Black Crusade]]. Much of the Imperium was divided in two by the subsequent formation of the [[Great Rift]], and in an event known as [[The Blackness]] many worlds fell to the ensuing chaos. Fortunately for mankind, the [[Primarch]] [[Roboute Guilliman]] has been reborn.

===Age of the Dark Imperium (c.999.M41-Onwards)===
{{main|Age of the Dark Imperium}}
The '''Age of the Dark Imperium''' directly follows the formation of the [[Great Rift]].{{Fn|5}} Though the Galaxy has been effectively split in two by the event, the Imperium has endured thanks to the efforts of [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|6}}

'''Apple-peaches''' are very expensive exotic fruits eaten in the [[Imperium]]. A drawback of the fruits, though, is that unless they are stored at a precise temperature of eighteen and a half degrees, they will become rotten within minutes.{{Fn|1}}

{{Ambig|subject=Imperial symbol|disambiguation=Aquila}}

The '''Aquila'''{{Fn|1a}} (plural: ''Aquilae''{{Fn|10}}) (also known as '''Imperial Aquila''' {{Fn|5}}, '''great Aquila'''{{Fn|15}} and '''Imperial Eagle'''{{Fn|2}}) normally{{Fn|29}}{{Fn|Note 1}} refers to a two-headed eagle{{Fn|1a}}{{Fn|3}} that symbolizes the [[Pax Imperialis]], the oath that binds together all [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperial]] servants under the banner of the [[Emperor of Mankind]]{{Fn|2}}. It is a universal symbol within the Imperium and
more than anything else represents the dominion of the Emperor.{{Fn|29}} It is also said that the Eagle and its variations symbolize both the Imperium as such and also loyalty to the Emperor as its master.{{Fn|8}} It also is the heraldic device of the [[Adeptus Terra|Imperial state]] and at the same time holy symbol of the [[Imperial Cult]].{{Fn|10}} The double-headed eagle also represents the union of the [[Mechanicum]] of [[Mars]] and the Emperor{{Fn|12a}} or between Mars and [[Terra]]{{Fn|14}}.
[[Image:Imperial Eagle.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The ''Aquila'', symbol of the [[Imperium of Mankind]]{{Fn|3}}]]

==History==
===Pre-Great Crusade===
Before the formalisation of the ''Eagle'' (also see [[Raptor Imperialis]]) as the symbol of the [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperium]] the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]]'s personal device was the [[Thunderbolt and lightning]] emblem which was used during the [[Unification Wars]].{{Fn|11f}} But the ''Imperial Eagle'' also is a symbol of the Emperor's ''War of Unification''.{{Fn|14}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Mark1PowerArmour.jpg|[[Power_Armour#Mark_1_.22Thunder_Armour.22|Mark 1 Power Armour]]  as used during the wars to unify the [[Terra]]n system without ''Aquilae''{{Fn|26}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Great Crusade/Pre-Heresy===
When the newly-found [[Fulgrim]] was brought to [[Terra]] by the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] to join his, Fulgrim's, [[Emperor's Children|Legion]] the [[Primarch]] addressed his warriors in a speech. Tasking them with bringing the wisdom of the Emperor to all the stars and underlining that they were the children of the Emperor. The Emperor was so impressed by these words that he bestowed a unique honour on Fulgrim's Legion: They would be permitted to display the ''Imperial Eagle'' on their armour chestplates - the only Legion permitted to do so.{{Fn|27}} Possibly{{Fn|Note 2}} the ''Aquila'' was also already being used more generally on [[Power Armour]] during this and later times.{{Fn|26}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:AquilaECPH2.jpg|[[Horus Heresy|Pre-Heresy]] [[Emperor's Children]] with ''Aquilae'' displayed on the chest armour and atop standards{{Fn|27}}
File:AquilaMark2.jpg|[[Power_Armour#Mark_2_.22Crusade_Armour.22|Mark 2]] ''Crusade Armour'' with ''Aquila''{{Fn|26}}{{Fn|Note 2}}
File:AquilaMark3.jpg|[[Power_Armour#Mark_3_.22Iron_Armour.22|Mark 3]] ''Armorum Ferrum''/''Iron Suit'' or ''Iron Armour'' with ''Aquila''{{Fn|26}}{{Fn|Note 2}}
File:AquilaMark4.jpg|[[Power_Armour#Mark_4_.22Imperial_Maximus_Suit.22|Mark 4]] ''Imperial Maximus'' with ''Aquila''{{Fn|26}}{{Fn|Note 2}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

There has been at least a five ''Aquila'' coin in use as [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperial]] currency in the time prior to the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|11a}}

===Horus Heresy===
Towards the end of the [[Horus Heresy]] when the final battle for [[Mars]] was underway the [[Power Armour|armour]] development teams were evacuated from Mars to [[Terra]] where they continued their work. The result of their work was the [[Power_Armour#Mark_7_.22Aquila_.28Imperator.2C_Eagle.29_Armour.22|Mark 7]] ''Armorum Impetor'' or ''Eagle Armour'' which takes its common name from the ''Eagle'' device it bears. The ''Eagle Armour'' started to reach the loyalist [[Space Marine]] defenders on Terra and on the Moon when [[Horus]] and his forces overcame the last resistance on Mars.{{Fn|26}} For possible uses of the ''Aquila'' on earlier marks see {{Fn|Note 2}}.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Design and meanings==
The ''Aquila'' most commonly{{Fn|29}} has two heads looking into different directions{{Fn|29}}, one said blinded to look at the past, one sighted to see to the future{{Fn|1a}} or one head gazing into the ''Materium'' while the other gazes into the ''[[Immaterium]]''{{Fn|29}}. Other sources associate the blind head with the [[Adeptus Astronomica]]{{Fn|6}}{{Fn|10}} and the seeing head with the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]]{{Fn|10}}{{Fn|Conflicting sources}}.

[[File:AquilaBedeutung.jpg|thumb|center|300px|The ''Aquila''{{Fn|6}}]]


The left wing (as seen from the viewer's perspective) represents the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]]{{Fn|6}}{{Fn|Conflicting sources}} while the right wing represents the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]]{{Fn|6}}{{Fn|10}}. The Eagle's body stands for the [[Adeptus Custodes]]{{Fn|6}}{{Fn|10}}, while the left, straight claw (again as seen from the viewer's perspective) represents the [[Administratum]] and the right, crooked claw the [[Adeptus Arbites]].{{Fn|6}}{{Fn|10}}

==Usage==
The device of the ''Aquila'' is generally used throughout the galaxy wherever the [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperium]] wishes to proclaim its authority.{{Fn|10}} Typical examples include architecture{{Fn|12c}}, armour, vehicles (like space ships{{Fn|1c}}{{Fn|31a}}{{Fn|31b}}), weapons, containers{{Fn|1d}} etc.{{Fn|10}} and - at least prior to the [[Horus Heresy]] - also currency, i.e. on coins{{Fn|11a}}:
*''Aquilae'' are frequently worn by [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperial]] servants, for example on clothing, ceremonial dresses, armour or in the form of jewelry (for example as a necklace{{Fn|12d}}{{Fn|12e}} or as a brooch{{Fn|16}}), tattoos{{Fn|12b}}{{Fn|15}} (or as etchings across shoulder blades{{Fn|1b}}) or other adornments.{{Fn|10}}

File:AquilaOgryn.jpg|On the shoulder guard of an [[Ogryn]]{{Fn|20c}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

*The Aquila typically adorns the chestpiece of [[Space Marine]] [[Power Armour]].{{Fn|5}}
*It also is ubiquitous on medals like the [[Astra Militarum Honours]]{{Fn|28}} and can also be found as the [[Aquila Token]]{{Fn|29}}.

File:Aquila1.jpg|The ''[[Aquila Token]]''{{Fn|29}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
*It also appears on vehicles as an affirmation of loyalty.{{Fn|2}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

*There has been at least a five Aquila coin in use as [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperial]] currency in the time prior to the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|11a}}
*Other objects bearing or taking the form of an ''Aquila'' include but are not limited too: A bar on [[Sameter]] using the symbol as a advertising neon sign{{Fn|18}}, as a watermark on paper{{Fn|12a}}and iron candelabras.{{Fn|30}}

==Sign of the Aquila==
The ''Sign of the Aquila'' (often shortened to simply ''Aquila'') is a sign of devotion to the [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperium]]{{Fn|4}} also used for example as a sign of defiance against [[Warp entity|Warp entities]]{{Fn|11c}}. It was used a sign of devotion from early on{{Fn|1e}}. It is also known to have been used as a formal greeting between at least [[Space Marines]]{{Fn|11b}} and as a sign of respect towards fallen brothers{{Fn|11d}}.

Descriptions of how to actually do this sign are however a bit unclear: In one instance it is said that hands are placed or pressed to one's chest, palms open, blades of fingers extended and thumbs raised{{Fn|1f}} while others say and show the thumbs are interlocked or crossed{{Fn|4}}{{Fn|9}}{{Fn|15}} while yet another source says the &quot;fingers&quot; are &quot;laced&quot; into the shape on an ''Aquila''{{Fn|17}}.

[[File:Signoftheaquila.jpg|thumb|center|150px|The ''Sign of the Aquila''{{Fn|9}}]]

==Other information==
*Soldiers of the [[Imperial Guard]] are obliged to salute (amongst others) any image of the ''Aquila'' - failure to do so is punished by being branded on the left cheek and a court-martial.{{Fn|7}}
*When no proper altar to the [[Emperor of Mankind]] is available one can be improvised by [[Imperial Guard]] officers to conduct their ceremonies: under certain circumstances and at certain times an ''Aquila'' standard is suspended from a wall and a yellow chalk cross on the floor beneath it then marks the sacred spot.{{Fn|18}}
*At least servants of the [[Ecclesiarchy]] are expected to make the ''Sign of the Aquila'' when facing an Ecclesiarchical shrine or when seeing a sign of [[Chaos|the Ruinous Powers]].{{Fn|9}} Making the sign to honour altars also is a known practice amongst other Imperial servants.{{Fn|30}}
*''Aquila'' devices have been known to become the focus of tangible manifestations of religious power.{{Fn|10}}{{Fn|12e}}
*At least prior to the [[Horus Heresy]]{{Fn|11e}} it was considered a &quot;great crime&quot; to damage the ''Imperial Eagle'' on the chestplate of the [[Emperor's Children]].{{Fn|11e}}

==Trivia==
{{trivia}}

''Aquila'' simply is the [[Wikipedia:Aquila|Latin and Romance languages word for eagle]].

Double-headed eagles are or have been used in many different contexts [[Wikipedia:Double-headed eagle|throughout history]]: &quot;In heraldry and vexillology, the double-headed eagle (or double-eagle) is a charge associated with the concept of ''Empire''. Most modern uses of the symbol are directly or indirectly associated with its use by the [[Wikipedia:Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]], whose use of it represented the Empire's dominion over the Near East and the West.&quot;

Modern day users of the emblem are as diverse as [[Wikipedia:Albania|Albania]], [[Wikipedia:Serbia|Serbia]], [[Wikipedia:Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Wikipedia:Russia|Russia]], the [[Wikipedia:Hellenic Army|Hellenic Army]], different Orthodox Christian Churches and also cities such as [[Wikipedia:Toledo, Spain|Toledo (Spain)]], [[Wikipedia:Velletri|Velletri (Italy)]], [[Wikipedia:Rijeka|Rijeka (Croatia)]] or [[Wikipedia:Konya|Konya (Turkey)]] to name but a few.

===Notes===
===={{Endn|Note 1}}====
Since the word ''Aquila'' simply means &quot;eagle&quot; special attention should be paid to the exact context and wording of sources. Sometimes ''Aquila'', ''Eagle'' or ''Imperial Eagle'' might refer to the double-headed symbol, but sometimes it might also denote a normal, one-headed eagle.

===={{Endn|Note 2}}====
Due to the lack of supplies during the [[Horus Heresy]] the different marks of [[Power Armour]] including older ones were used throughout the conflict and even thereafter.{{Fn|26}} In addition older marks came to be associated with the history or past deeds and are therefore still used and much sought after up to current times.{{Fn|26}} Since these images are not precisely dated it is impossible to say if the use of the ''Aquila'' was a constant or temporary feature or when it started.

=={{Endn|Conflicting sources}}==
The image of the ''Aquila'' in [[Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader]]{{Fn|6}} relatively clearly shows that the inscription &quot;Adeptus Astra Telepathica&quot; is connected to the left wing and not to the sighted head of the eagle. But [[The Inquisition (Background Book)]]{{Fn|10}} unequivocally states that when &quot;depicted in correct detail&quot; the sighted head represents the &quot;Adeptus Astra Telepathica&quot;. Therefore it could be assumed that the image in ''Rogue Trader'' is incorrect. But on the other hand ''The Inquisition'' does not mention the left wing at all.{{Fn|10}}

'''Battle-Sign''' is an [[Imperial]] [[Sign Language]] used by [[Space Marines]], which was originally created by the [[Space Marine Legion]]s. It has diverged over the millennia since the Legions' were [[Founding|divided]] into [[Chapter]]s, though, and each has adapted the language for its own use.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Bell of Lost Souls''' is sounded when a great hero of the Imperium dies or a [[Grey Knight]] falls in battle{{Fn|4}}. It is located on [[Terra]] at the peak of the [[Tower of Heroes]]. It is ancient, like most of the equipment on Terra, and as big as a building. It is also covered in runes and its sound is said to be like the scream of an anguished god that lasts for a long time and reaches the ears of millions of the inhabitants of Terra.{{Fn|1}} 

When rung, servants that maintain the bell must be sealed in reinforced shelters in order to prevent ruptured eardrums, followed by death from lung bursting and embolism.{{Fn|4}}

The bell was first ordered to toll by the Emperor fifty times for the [[Imperial Fists]] lost on the [[Uranus]] orbitals during the [[Unheard War]], after their actions saved the [[Sol System]].{{Fn|5}} The bell was also rung one thousand times to honour each dead marine when the [[Fire Hawks]] [[Chapter]] was lost.{{Fn|2}}{{Fn|3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a area of the [[Imperial Palace]] on [[Terra]].{{Fn|1}}

Existing before the construction of the palace itself, the Bastion was a place of counsel and refuge for warlords and tyrants since before the [[Age of Strife]].{{Fn|1}} Standing half a kilometre wide at the base, it was rumoured to have resisted all attempts to demolish it regardless of the amount of explosives applied.{{Fn|3}}

After the [[Unification Wars]], it was absorbed into the growing Imperial Palace complex.{{Fn|1}} During the [[Horus Heresy]], the Bastion alongside the ''[[Phalanx]]'' became the command center of [[Rogal Dorn]] and the [[Imperial Fists]], overseeing the defence of the entire [[Sol System]].{{Fn|1}} During the final stages of the [[Siege of Terra]], the Bhab Bastion itself was besieged by traitor forces, trapping Dorn and much of the Imperial Fists inside as [[Sanguinius]] waged the desperate defence of the [[Eternity Gate]].{{Fn|4}}

Mere hours after Sanguinius succeeded in holding the Eternity Gate, the Bhab Bastion fell in a [[Sons of Horus]] assault led by [[Catulan Reaver]] [[Space Marine Captain|Captain]] [[Tarchese Malabreux]]. Much of Dorn's command staff were slain at their posts as the Primarch himself led a chaotic retreat into the [[Sanctum Imperialis]].{{Fn|5}}

==Notable Areas==
*'''Grand Borealis Strategium''' - Dorn's central control room during the [[Siege of Terra]].{{Fn|2}}
*'''Sanctuary of Satya''' - The oldest part of the bastion and located on an off-shoot. This hall was open to the elements and held some of the last vegetation in the [[Inner Palace]]. During the fortification of Terra it was one of the places the [[Emperor]] demanded be left untouched alongside the [[Hall of Victories]] and the [[Great Chamber of the Senatorum Imperialis]].{{Fn|2}}

'''Black Markets''' are hidden criminal underground markets, that deal in the rarest and most dangerous of goods, especially those that have been outlawed by the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

At their most mundane, a Black Market might offer pilfered [[Enforcer]] and [[PDF|Militia]] weaponry, chems or even rare wargear. At their more esoteric, they may sell strange [[Xenos]] weaponry and creatures brought in via the [[Cold Trade]] or even objects imbued with the [[Warp]].{{Fn|1}}

[[Gretchin]] are also known to operate their own type of Black Market, within their [[Ork]] dominated society. This includes selling fungus-beer, roasting [[squig]]s on sticks, coordinating the bets when a fight breaks out or looting corpses for fun and profit.{{Fn|2}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are an armed force of the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]], having been active since the [[Great Crusade]] and [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|2}} 

Black Sentinels provide security for [[Astropath]]s and their facilities across the [[Sol System]] and beyond. They are also entrusted with the task of eliminating compromised [[Psyker]]s, prowling across the gantries and corridors of the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica|Telepathica]] headquarters on [[Terra]], forever poised for the first twitch or spasm of possession. Well-trained and armed with [[Lasgun]]s, they are dressed in black armor and wear masks that resemble snarling beasts.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|2}}

'''Blackfort''' is an [[Imperial]] prison, which is rarely used by the [[Imperial Fists]] [[Chapter]] as a source for [[Aspirant]]s.{{Fn|1}}
==Description==
These come from Blackfort's separated [[Juve]] wing for males, which is known as the '''Wolf Pit'''. Though some placed in the Wolf Pit are still children, they will find themselves forced to kill other Juve prisoners in order to survive. Fights to the death are also allowed to take place there in an arena, by Blackfort's '''Chief Wardens''' and the prison's [[Shock Baton]] wielding guards have the right to place bets on the fights. Many Juves have breathed their last on its sandy floor and the fighter with the highest deaths to their name is known as the '''Pit Champion'''. On the rare occasions the [[Imperial Fists]] contact the Chief Wardens to see Blackfort's best Juve fighter, it is the Champions the Wardens select for the honor.{{Fn|1}} 

Though just being selected does not mean the '''Pit Champions''' will become an [[Aspirant]]. Instead the Champions must undergo a final fight against an adult Blackfort prisoner, which will be watched over by a packed crowed of prisoners, guards and the Imperial Fists themselves. The Pit Champions are not told any of this beforehand, however, only that important guests wish to see Blackfort's best [[Juve]] fighter and that the Champions will not be told about who they will face in the arena. This is done on the Imperial Fists' orders, as the [[Chapter]] wishes to see how the Pit Champions will adapt in a fight. The Wardens, however, are allowed to tell the Champions that winning this final battle will change their lives forever. Should the Pit Champions succeed in killing their opponent, then they will be taken away from the prison, to begin their training to become Imperial Fists.{{Fn|1}} 

[[Maximmion Voss]] is known to have been recruited from Blackfort and the former '''Pit Champion''' left the prison with sixty-one kills to his name. Most were [[Juve]]s that he killed in the arena, but the last was the adult prisoner [[Grammond]], whose death secured Voss' future as an [[Imperial Fist]].{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:KalJerichoArt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kal Jericho]], a [[Necromundan]] Bounty Hunter{{Fn|4}}]]
'''Bounty Hunters''' are [[Imperial]] or [[Xenos]] citizens who are licensed by their worlds to capture or kill fugitives, criminals and creatures for a bounty{{Fn|1a}}. Some Imperial worlds are known to even allow [[Mutants]], [[Abhumans]] and [[Xenos]] to serve as Bounty Hunters as well.{{Fn|3a}} 

==Necromundan Bounty Hunters==
On [[Necromunda]], they are amongst the toughest and most dangerous of all [[Underhive]]rs and are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. They tend to be loners who neither need nor want to be associated with a gang, though some are erstwhile gangers and might still bear some of the distinctive trappings of their former Clan House. Many [[Abhuman]]s on Necronmunda also find the life of a Bounty Hunter suits them well, for the [[Blood Warrant]] that serves as their license and writ allows them to go where others of their kind might ordinarily be barred. Thus, it is not uncommon to see [[Beastmen]], [[Squat]]s and other stable Abhuman strains operating as Bounty Hunters far from those areas on Necronmunda that are set aside for their kind{{Fn|1a}}. The [[Merchants Guild]] also has their own private order of Bounty Hunters, known as '''Adurators''', who are granted special privileges and are equipped with the best weaponry and equipment the Guild has to offer. While they normally work on Guild bounties, it is not unusual for an Adurator to also collect bounties in the Underhive, where they can more easily throw their Guild authority around.{{Fn|1b}}

The majority of official bounties on Necronmunda are displayed at Trading Posts in the Underhive, and offer rewards to anyone who brings in outlaw leaders, gangs, mutants and other criminal types. The rewards offered are good, but the job is a perilous one and many Bounty Hunters die out in the wastes, slain by the outlaws and mutants they set out to hunt{{Fn|1a}}. While they tend to work alone, some bounties may be so dangerous that it requires several Bounty Hunters to work together in brief alliances called '''Venators'''{{Fn|2}}. Though some can become permanent partnerships and it is not unusual to see Venators, composed of blood relatives whose families have bounty hunted for generations{{Fn|3a}}. It is also common for Bounty Hunters to hire their services to a gang leader, if there are no decent bounties to be had or if their interests and the gang's are aligned, but such allegiances tend to be temporary.{{Fn|1a}}

The Hive World also has the [[Psykanarium Psi-Hound|Psi-Hound]]s, which are bounty hunting [[Psykers]] created and controlled by Lord [[Helmawr]]'s Psykanarium program, and the [[Psylock Cabals]], who offer to hire out their Psykers to Bounty Hunters.{{Fn|3a}}

'''Chiromancers''' are [[Imperial]] [[Psykers]], who have been medically and psychically trained to treat victims of [[Warp]]-born diseases.{{Fn|1}} 

Despite their skills, however, those given to their care, suffer from maladies of the soul and body, which few survive. Due to the nature of their work, Chiromancers serve aboard [[Isolation Ship]]s and wear [[Hazard Suit]]s, while treating their patients. By doing this, the [[Imperium]] limits the risk of any Warp disease spreading and endangering its worlds. High ranking members of the Chiromancer order, are known as '''Chiromancer-Captains'''.{{Fn|1}}

'''''Civitas Imperialis''''' is an [[Imperial]] term most simply translated as ''&quot;the Imperial rule of law,&quot;'' although its true meaning is more specific.  When the [[Imperium of Man]] was founded, the ''Civitas'' was laid down to ''&quot;guarantee the safety and assurance of any citizen of the Imperium of Mankind, wherever he or she travels or sets foot within the length and breadth of the Imperium.&quot;''{{Fn|1c}}  The ''Civitas'' was thus an implicit promise to the Imperium's citizens of justice and the protection of the Imperium's soldiers and resources.

The ''Civitas Imperialis'' was officially suspended in the [[Sabbat Worlds]] in 741.[[M41]], a final acknowledgment that the [[sector]] had been lost to the forces of [[Chaos]].{{Fn|1a}}  Part of [[Lord Militant]] [[Slaydo]]'s remit from the [[High Lords of Terra]], as the newly-appointed [[Warmaster]] of the [[Sabbat Worlds Crusade]], was to restore the ''Civitas Imperialis'' to that region.{{Fn|1b}} From his diaries, historians have concluded that Slaydo was determined to do so, within the fullest meaning of the term.{{Fn|1c}}

'''Clan Bannick''' is one of the [[Noble House|clan families]] of the [[sixth moon of Paragon VI]].{{Fn|1b}}

The clan's main industry was in opticals.{{Fn|1f}}

==History==
At one point, Clan Bannick was to be tied to [[Clan Turannigen]] by the marriage of [[Colaron Vor Artem Lo Bannick|Colaron Bannick]] (son of his clan's Chief Auditor) and [[Kaithalar Beyn Lo Turannigen|Kaithalar Turannigen]] (her clan's Warden). However, after Colaron killed his cousin, [[Tuparillio]], in an honour duel, he enlisted with the [[Astra Militarum]] as penance and the marriage was consequently called off.{{Fn|1b}}{{Fn|1c}} This led to Clan Bannick suffering a 0.3% gross reduction in interclan trade and Colaron was effectively disowned by his father and most of the clan.{{Fn|1b}}

'''Clan Habeyl''' was once the [[Imperial Commander|ruling]] [[Imperial House]] of the [[Hive World]] [[Garmesh]].{{Fn|1}}
==History==
They had ruled there for many generations, but the string of Habeyl rulers proved to be incompetent and aided in [[Garmesh]]'s decline. This caused the [[Hive World]] to lose its position as the beating heart of the [[Mathenda Sub-sector]] and resulted in Garmesh's population languishing in poverty, while its indolent [[Imperial Commander]]s hid in their [[Hive Spire|Spire Fortresses]] and ignored their plight. The latest head of the Clan, [[Habeyl VII]] was no different, but in [[M42]] the resentment towards him, led nine [[Unsanctioned Psyker]]s of Garmesh' population to form a [[Seercult|cabal]], within its [[Underhive]]. They had done so after listening to a voice in visions they received as they were dreaming, which the cabal believed was the [[Emperor]]. This voice bade them to pool their powers together to save Garmesh and the cabal called itself the [[Heralds of Change]], and set about mounting a sorcerous insurrection upon the Hive World.{{Fn|1}}  

[[Habeyl VII]] would not take their threat seriously until it was too late and the [[Heralds of Change|Heralds]] began to threaten his rule of [[Garmesh]]. He would send out [[astropathic]] pleas for aid and to be evacuated, before then joining his fellow [[Noble]]s in hiding within their [[Hive Spire]] fortresses. There, they would wait in safety as the Noble's household guards held back the [[Seercult|cabal]]'s onslaught, until help could arrive to defeat the cabal. Once the Heralds learned of this, they became desperate and with victory so close at hand, the cabal beseeched the [[God-Emperor]] to aid them. However it was not the Emperor, but the [[Lord of Change]] [[Tz'Keth'K'Zar]] who answered their plea. It was the [[Greater Daemon]] who had been speaking to them in their visions and was all to pleased to aid them. Once the Lord of Change materialized upon Garmesh, the Heralds were turned into a [[Warp Gate]], through which the legions of [[Tzeentch]] invaded the Hive World. It would then be enveloped by the [[Chaos God]]'s power, though sometime later the [[Imperial Navy]] [[Frigate]] [[Hopeful Saint]] arrived to evacuate Habeyl. Its crew was stunned by the Hive World's fate and the warship's [[Shipmaster|Shipmistress]] [[Endara]], was also unable to make contact with the [[Imperial Commander]]. Before she could decide on what to do next, Tzeentch Daemons invaded the Hopeful Saint and set its bridge aflame with [[Warp]]fire.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Clan Mackenzie''' was the ruling family of the [[Imperial]] planet [[Dunroamin VI]].{{Fn|1}}

The clan was sentenced to death when it was found that they had financed [[pirate]]s to raid the rival [[Mining World]]s of [[Rouan]] and [[Nearly-There]].  A single [[Eversor Assassin]] was deployed on Dunroamin VI during a yearly festival known as the [[Grand Hootmanay]] to [[Slaughter of Clan Mackenzie|slaughter the entire clan]].  The assassin succeeded, killing all 317 members.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Codex Crisis''' was an incident that nearly led the [[Imperium]] into another civil war, after the [[Imperial Fists]]' [[Primarch]] [[Dorn]] refused to follow the recently created [[Codex Astartes]].{{Fn|1}}
==History==
This was because [[Dorn]]'s [[Imperial Fists]] [[Space Marine Legion|Legion]] would have to take part in the [[Second Founding]], where it would be divided into [[Chapter]]s. His resistance nearly brought about a civil war within the [[Loyalist]] [[Space Marine Legion|Legion]]s, until the [[Primarch]] finally relented and accepted the [[Codex Astartes]]. Its unclear what caused Dorn to change his mind, but the Imperial Fists have since had a close adherence to the Codex. Some speculate that this is because the Primarch instructed his sons to embrace the change of the Second Founding.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Cold Trade''' is an [[Imperial]] term for the illegal, but highly profitable, smuggling of [[Xenos]]tech and other illicit goods into the Imperium.{{Fn|1}}

[[Rogue Trader]]s and [[Chartist captain]]s are known to partake in Cold Trading, where they can make a large profit, by traveling to out of the way [[system]]s to buy illegal goods and then later selling them in the Imperium for inflated prices. The risks for doing so are high for these Cold Traders, though, because if they are caught by the Imperium, they could have their ship impounded and be stripped of their license.{{Fn|1}}

[[Pirate]]s and other criminal classes are known to be relied on by the Traders and Captains to find the illegal goods that power the Cold Trade, but sometimes this ends in betrayal. Instead of arriving at a rendezvous for an expected trading of goods, the pirates will instead rob the Traders and Captains leaving them with nothing but their lives. Some of these outcasts even attempt to simply conduct the Cold Trade themselves, but risk their lives in doing so. For if they are captured, then the [[Inquisition]] will become involved and will ensure these Cold Traders are tortured, before being executed for their crimes.{{Fn|1}}

The Conservatory Project was an academic institution that operated outside of the [[Administratum]] prior to the Horus Heresy. It was founded by [[Kasper Hawser]].

==Background==
The Conservatory Project was founded approximately 872.[[M30]] by Dr. Kasper Hawser. It was granted its charter at the Conclave of [[wikipedia:Lutetia|Lutetia]]{{Fn|1a}}. The purpose of the Project was to unify mankind by rediscovery of culture and technology lost during the [[Age of Strife]] and to understand why the Age of Strife happened.{{Fn|1b}}

Prior to the beginning of the [[Horus Heresy]] the Conservatory Project included over 30,000 officers on [[Terra]] and an additional 250,000 freelance associates, archaeologists and off world numbers.{{Fn|1a}} It enjoyed the personal approval and interest of both the [[Emperor of Mankind]] and [[Malcador (Character)|Malcador the Sigillite]].{{Fn|1c}}

'''Corpse-Starch''' (also known as '''&quot;Soylent Veridian&quot;'''{{Fn|2}}) is food created from the recycled dead bodies of the [[Imperial citizen|Imperium's citizens]]. On [[Necromunda]], the [[Corpse Guild]] is responsible for overseeing its creation.{{Fn|1}}


==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
The alternative name for corpse-starch, Soylent Veridian, is a potential reference to the 1973 film ''[[Wikipedia:Soylent Green|Soylent Green]]'' (the titular substance being a foodstuff made from reprocessed human corpses).

{{ThousandSonsPortal}}
The '''Council of Nikaea''' was a great convocation called by the [[Emperor of Mankind]] in 001.[[M31]]{{Fn|12}} to discuss the use of psychic powers in the [[Imperium]], particularly within the [[Legiones Astartes]]. It took place in the waning years of the [[Great Crusade]], and would be one of the last notable gatherings of historically important personages before the outbreak of the [[Horus Heresy]]. While termed a 'council', the methodology of the debate and the persecution they felt they suffered because of it led the [[Thousand Sons]] [[Space Marine Legion]] to refer to the event as the '''Trial of the Thousand Sons''' or the '''Trial of Magnus the Red'''.{{Cite This}} To some later [[Imperial]] scholars, the Council was also known as the '''Hearing of the Thousands'''.{{Fn|8}}

==History==
===The Librarian Crisis===
The young Imperium was wary of the development of psychic potential among the population; the means to reasonably successfully monitor and control such mutant developments did not yet exist, and there was deep distrust and bias amongst the various factions that saw, or did not see, a benefit to allowing those with psychic powers to remain unchained...or even alive. Many individuals with psychic powers were put to use by the Imperium, the most important being the [[Navigators]] who made safe space-travel possible, but even these [[psykers]] were barely tolerated by some. Any grouping of psykers was bound to draw comment, and so it proved with the Thousand Sons Legiones Astartes.{{Fn|1}}

The Thousand Sons drew regular criticism simply for existing throughout much of the early part of their career, seen as potentially dangerous due to the psychic talents of their Legionaries. Anti-psykers decried them as an example of the problem writ large, an imminent threat to the Imperium. Cries for their disbandment were loud; the discovery of their [[primarch]], [[Magnus]], quietened these calls for a time.{{Fn|1}}

Magnus and two other primarchs - [[Sanguinius]] of the [[Blood Angels]], and [[Jaghatai Khan]] of the [[White Scars]] - proposed that [[Librarius]] Departments should be formed in the Legions to harness the latent psychic powers that were beginning to manifest in the Astartes of some Legions. Initially, the Emperor sanctioned the experiments and then allowed the deliberate recruitment of psychic candidates into Legions that did not already posses such mutants; however, as he withdrew from the fighting of the crusade, many called for him to pass judgment on whether the experiment should continue.{{Fn|2d}} {{Fn|3}}

The reasoning for this was twofold. Firstly, as the Great Crusade reached further from the light of [[Terra]], stranger and stranger foes were faced. Many times the Legiones Astartes or the [[Imperial Army]] would discover a new world, only to be met by hostile action from beings who wielded mysterious, sorcerous-seeming powers; powers that resembled those employed by the Thousand Sons and the legion Librarians.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|3}}

The second was that the Thousand Sons were seen to be potentially dangerously unstable by none other than [[Leman Russ (Primarch)|Leman Russ]], primarch of the [[Space Wolves]] and long a distruster of the Thousand Sons' martial doctrines and battle-philosophy. On the world of [[Ark Reach Secundus|Shrike]], the Russ witnessed a Thousand Son fall victim to a malady called the [[flesh-change]]; uncontrolled physical degeneration and grand mal mutation apparently brought on by the loss of psychic control. Announcing that he had turned a blind eye to Magnus' &quot;obvious&quot; dabbling in black arts up to this point, the [[Wolf King]] declared that he was done ignoring his brother's tainted ways and claimed that the entire Thousand Sons legion was corrupted. He further promised a reckoning.{{Fn|2a}}

Leman Russ' voice joined that of [[Mortarion]]'s, long a critic of the Thousand Sons and psykers in general and who now openly accused Magnus of sorcery, and  that of [[Corax]] and [[Rogal Dorn]], who both refused to field their Legions alongside the Thousand Sons and even other legions that deployed [[Librarians]] upon occasion. Their outcry now so insistent that it soon became a major point of contention across the entire Imperium, with the primarchs split over the issue. Eventually, on the brink of leaving the Great Crusade after the ascension of [[Horus Lupercal]] to the position of [[Warmaster]], the Emperor was forced to call a conclave of the [[War Council]] of the Great Crusade to resolve the issue of psykers amidst the Legiones Astartes, with himself acting as arbiter. The world chosen for the great Council was called [[Nikaea]].{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|3}}

===Nikaea===
:{{main|Nikaea}}
Nikaea was a world that, during the time of the Great Crusade, was in its geological infancy. Clouds completely obscured the surface while tectonic movement created constant pyroclastic eruptions and storms across the planet. Its very fabric in flux, clods of ejected matter were caught in orbit or drifted across the system, with gravitational waves and electromagnetic discharges swamping local space. Navigating through all this to a point on the surface would've been impossible if not for a psychic beacon generated by the Emperor. The planet was said to be galactically remote. The surface of the still-forming world was littered with curious extrusions of rock and magma that had taken on various largely geometric shapes; Magnus claimed that this oddity was likely a reason the Emperor had selected the planet, as it echoed the origins of Magnus' belief in the ordered nature of the universe.{{Fn|2b}}

[[Perturabo]] both designed and built the council chambers. Although originally designed as an arena for competitive events, The Emperor would later repurpose it for his own use.{{Fn|9}} The council chambers were created on Nikaea within a hollowed out stratovolcano, a massive amphitheatre having been carved out of its heart. The beacon projected by the Emperor was visible to those with mindsight as a beam of light shooting straight up out of the volcano, wreathed in golden lighting. Magnus saw this as a magnificent sign of the wonders of psychic powers and a validation of his stance before the Council even began. His [[Chief Librarian]], [[Ahzek Ahriman]], on the other hand, was dismayed by the sheer power on display, realising it was tied to a prophetic vision he had previously experienced that promised disaster. Casual use of psychic powers at the Council was difficult; Ahriman put this down to the presence of the Emperor.{{Fn|2b}}

Security within the Council was a privilege taken by the [[Adeptus Custodes]], as was their right and duty when the Emperor himself was present; though a three-[[Great Company]]-strong force of Space Wolves were present to act - according to them - as a no-quarter safety measure in case Magnus made the 'wrong decision' in reaction to events. They were accompanied by a detachment of the [[Sisters of Silence]], which made their presence (and that of their primarch, Leman Russ) psychically undetectable. Arrivals to the Council site had to submit control of their vessels to Custodes remote pilots, who berthed the ships at secured landing zones. Private quarters for attendees ringed the amphitheatre, which itself could seat thousands upon the tiered black stone seating. The amphitheatre was open to the elements, but workings of the [[Mechanicum]] kept the storm at bay. Massive environmental control machinery allowed the juvenile world to prematurely support life. The command and control position for the entire installation was staffed by several hundred operatives of the [[Imperial Fleet]], the [[Hegemonic Corps]], the Space Wolves, the Sisters of Silence and the Adeptus Custodes. The Emperor and his immediate retinue sat upon a pyramidal dais at one side of the amphitheatre (the side opposite on which Magnus' quarters were located).{{Fn|2b}}{{Fn|4}}

===The Council Convenes===
The Council was presided over by [[Malcador the Sigillite]], Regent Lord of Terra and personal confidant of the Emperor. He carried the Emperor's golden scepter as a sign that he held authority over the assembled. The Thousand Sons delegation was the last to arrive, uninformed of the true nature of the Council. Immediately after their arrival, Magnus and Ahriman were taken into the crowded public amphitheatre to be sworn in; it was at this moment that they realised, wearily and with shocked dismay respectively, the true nature of the 'council' they had been summoned to attend, at least for them.{{Fn|2b}}

The primary objective of the Council of Nikaea was to determine what to do about the Librarian Crisis that described the division between the Legions over the continued use of Librarians on the battlefield and for Magnus to face the charges of sorcery. Many interpreted the Council as in actuality the Trial of Magnus the Red; he was accused of sorcery and of corrupting the [[Space Marine Legions]] through the introduction of Librarians into them and their training by seconded warrior-scholars of the Thousand Sons.{{Fn|2d}}{{Fn|3}}

Malcador announced that those gathered had been summoned to freely debate the issue - causing some consternation in the crowd - and whether the use of Librarians was outright sorcery that caused a threat to human galactic domination, or if such claims were fearful, ignorant mewlings. He closed this opening address with an invite for anyone to make the first speech. The first to stand was a [[Rune Priest]] of the [[Space Wolves]] known as [[Othere Wyrdmake]].{{Fn|2b}}

===The Accusations===
Wyrdmake, as a psyker himself and as someone considered a respected colleague by Ahriman, may have been thought to have spoken out in defence of Librarians. Quite the opposite occurred - claiming knowledge of the Thousand Sons due to fighting alongside them on Shrike and [[Aghoru]], he denounced each and every one of them as warlocks, deceivers and sorcerers, swearing the truth of the matter upon his oath of loyalty to Leman Russ. Malcador commented that this was a serious accusation, and asked if anyone would support it; Mortarion, primarch of the [[Death Guard]] legion stepped forth.{{Fn|2d}}

Mortarion repeated his charge that Magnus was a practitioner of sorcery. He illuminated his side of the debate by reminding the listeners of his personal experiences, and the worlds he had seen ruined by individuals who peered too long into dark places. He further reminded them all that [[Old Night]] was caused by psykers, their actions almost destroying the species. He pointed to the existence of the Sisters of Silence, an Imperial body specifically created to do the apparently essential job of not only guarding against the danger of psykers, but hunting them down. He dwelled upon horrific imagery he had seen, memories of sorcerous powers and the horrors they can conjure, and the power of such arcane barbarians to hold off or defeat Imperial purity. He closed by stating that he did not believe that Magnus was such a monstrous person as he had described and dealt with in his younger days...but that he was walking on the same path. Acknowledging his long-held anti-Librarian beliefs, he pressed that he was condemning Magnus not out of hate, but out of brotherly love and concern, so that Magnus may stop before it was too late.{{Fn|2d}}{{Fn|3}}

Mortarion and Wyrdmake then invited chosen other speakers to the podium, where they made the case against Librarians for some three hours. After this, an interval took place before Magnus was scheduled to answer the accusations made against him.{{Fn|2b}} 

===The Testimony of the Crimson King===
Magnus recounted many great deeds of Librarians, and pointed out that psykers were essential to the running of the Imperium, gesturing at the assembled [[astropaths]] to illustrate his point.{{Fn|3}} He essayed that being fearful of the unknown was the mark of the ignorant and uneducated, ridiculous superstition, and that those without the courage to face new ideas sought to swamp them with scare-mongering. He pointed out that to people of previous historical periods, everything about a single individual at the Council would be regarded as magic, and that such long-ago people had beliefs that were proven wrong; the Sun does not orbit Terra after all, for example. He made an aside to Mortarion's testimony, claiming that the deepest desire leads to hate and lies, not love and concern.{{Cite this}}

He then spoke of he future; telling of what great deeds psykers can achieve and how much of a travesty the Council of Nikaea would be seen as by future Imperial citizens, as a barbarous event orchestrated by the ignorant. He refuted the claims against his legion, pointing out that the Thousand Sons fight at the forefront of the Great Crusade, taking the light of the Imperium to places others fear to tread and widening Imperial knowledge with their hunt for information. He then told a parable of men sitting around a fire in the dark of an underground cavern; one of their number discovers the light of outside, but his fellows are unwilling to believe him, content with the light from their fire. Wishing to illuminate his fellows, the explorer works hard, digging a great tunnel into the ceiling of the cavern and bringing the light to all his colleagues. That man knew he had to show his friends the truth, and strove to do so, despite their rejection and disbelief. Magnus claimed that in this case, the light is knowledge of the [[empyrean]] that he simply wanted to make available to everyone.{{Fn|2d}}

Magnus had spoken passionately with great power and the Council became even more divided. While effective, the Witch Hunters could not match Magnus' persuasiveness. The Council was once again adjourned. After the break, Magnus, who had felt that he had swayed many of those present with his testimony, was dismayed to pick up on a wide cloud of negative judgement now emanating from the Council, for reasons unknown to him, but perhaps having something to do with the events surrounding a servant of the Space Wolves... 

===Hidden Events===
Present amidst the concealed Space Wolves contingent - much to the consternation of Constantin Valdor - was [[Kasper Hawser]], [[Skjald]] of Tra, or Third Company. The reason Valdor was perturbed by his presence was that Leman Russ had earlier made it clear to the Chief Custodian that the Space Wolves suspected that Hawser was a [[Hidden One]] of the Thousand Sons; a deep-cover intelligence agent who unaware of their own status as a scouting conduit. His presence in the command centre constituted a serious security risk, even with the psi-blocking skills of the Sisters of Silence and the inert materials used in the construction of the Nikaea complex. However, these factors were the very reasons that the Russ decided to explore the possibility that Hawser ''was'' a Hidden One. After his debrief, Hawser was committed to the supervision of a senior Custode, [[Amon Tauromachian]], and allowed to watch the Council deliberate. It was during this time that the Thousand Sons made an apparent attempt to remove their apparently-compromised spy, as [[Amon]] , Master of the Hidden Ones and [[Equerry]] to Magnus the Red made a sorcerous attack on Amon Tauromachian and attempted to eliminate Hawser. Amon was driven off by the intervention of [[Bjorn]] of the Space Wolves, and the incident reported immediately; the Space Wolves fully under the impression that news of it would influence the judgement of the Emperor.{{Fn|4}}

Tragically for everyone concerned, it would later be revealed that the 'Amon' that attacked Tauromachian and Hawser was not in fact Amon of the Thousand Sons, but an aspect of the [[Primordial Annihilator]] masquerading as the Master of the Hidden Ones as part of [[Tzeentch|a convoluted scheme]] to remove the threat presented by both the Space Wolves and the Thousand Sons to the grand chaotic plan that would result in the [[Horus Heresy]]. The real Amon - and all the Thousand Sons present, including Magnus - had no idea of what had transpired in their names.{{Fn|4}}

===The Librarians Speak===
As the end of the Council approached, Malcador arose, and asked if there were any remaining who would like to speak, before final judgement was made.

The tension could easily have been cut with a knife when a group of Space Marine Librarians stood and approached the dais. Malcador the Sigillite acknowledged them with a nod, and all fell silent. Among the group were some of the greatest Librarians of the Space Marine Legions. One of their number, a junior [[White Scars]] marine called [[Targutai Yesugei]], spoke up, saying that there was nothing inherently evil about a Librarian. An Astartes psyker was akin to an athelete, a gifted individual who must be trained for the greatest results, or a [[bolter]] or [[Land Raider]], a weapon that must be treated with respect and not loosed indiscriminately. They proclaimed that the best way forward would be to firm up the training of human psykers across the galaxy, and that this be made an Imperial priority, not their eradication; for with such a group of trained specialists loyal to the Emperor, the galaxy could be taken with ease. They also stated that any study of sorcery must of course be forbidden, effectively presenting a 'third way' to the Council. Some versions of the story of the Council claim that the Emperor immediately agreed to this proposal, as if waiting for it.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|2d}} However, other events, more believable in the light of what would transpire, are also presented.

According to the [[Grimoire Hereticus]], a number of [[Librarian]]s attempted to storm out of the hall after they were horrified of the reactionary as well as the misguided direction the debate was taking place.{{Fn|8}}

===The Emperor's Decision===
Ultimately, in a speech to the gathered Astartes (which seemed to Ahzek Ahriman to be directly intended for Magnus himself{{Fn|2d}}), the Emperor issued what would become known as the '''Edict of Nikaea''', decreeing that the Legiones Astartes, beyond the use of Navigators and Astropaths, would no longer employ psykers. They were to disband their Librarius departments, the Librarians re-deployed to the battle companies and the primarchs themselves were to refrain from using any psychic powers they possessed. This of course applied to Magnus, whose use of sorcery was declared not proven.{{Fn|3}} The Emperor also gave one final warning:

{{QuoteBox
 |quote = ''''&quot;Woe betide he who ignores my warning or breaks faith with me. He shall be my enemy, and I will visit such destruction upon him and all his followers that, until the end of all things, he shall rue the day he turned from my light.&quot;''''' {{Fn|2d}}
 |source = - The Emperor, at Nikaea
 |width = 60em
 |align = center
}}

The Emperor was much enraged with Magnus personally. While he chose to refrain from outright announcing to the Council that Magnus was a sorcerer, the Emperor believed that Magnus had at least dabbled with the black arts. Seeing this as a personal betrayal - for the Emperor had, many years earlier, chosen to reveal secrets of the Warp to Magnus and Magnus alone - he issued his wayward son with a personal warning:

{{QuoteBox
 |quote = ''''&quot;If you treat with the Warp, Magnus, I shall visit destruction upon you. And your Legion's name will be struck from the Imperial records for all time&quot;''''' {{Fn|3}}
 |source = - The Emperor, at Nikaea
 |width = 60em
 |align = center
}}

It is said that Magnus' face appeared as if made from brittle stone at hearing this proclamation, stone upon the edge of cracking. Nevertheless, he bowed his knee to his father and pledged to obey. It was a pledge he would not keep.{{Fn|1}}

===Attendees===
A listing of notable attendees other than the Emperor of Mankind. It should be noted that there were several individuals in attendance whose identity remains hidden. This is due to the use of &quot;falsehoods&quot; that hid the identities of the person, or persons concealed behind them. The Emperor ordered that falsehoods be used so that no individuals' testimony would &quot;be corrupted by fear of those who's eyes are upon him.&quot;  It is implied by [[Ahzek Ahriman]] of the Thousand Sons that the individuals behind the falsehoods were in fact Primarchs from other Legions.{{Fn|2c}}{{Fn|2d}}

===Aftermath and Effects===
The Emperor's Decree would prove to be a severe handicap to the [[Loyalist]] legions that fought for him during the [[Horus Heresy]]. Not all Legions abided by the Decree and continued to use Librarians in secret, most notably the [[Alpha Legion]].{{Fn|13}}

During the [[Battle of Calth]], when the [[Word Bearers]] summoned hordes of [[daemon]]s, [[Roboute Guilliman]] ruefully considered that Nikaea had deprived the [[Ultramarines]] of their best weapon against denizens of the Warp, the [[Librarius]]. Guilliman also resolved that, if they survived the battle, their first order of business would be to see the Decree abolished. Guilliman noted that the timing was so convenient that it almost seemed like [[Tzeentch|someone]] had planned it.{{Fn|5}} During the Battle, [[Nathaniel Garro]], a loyalist Captain of the [[Death Guard]], recruited [[Tylos Rubio]], a former [[Codicier]] of the Ultramarines, on the orders of [[Malcador the Sigillite]]. Malcador later gave Rubio free rein to use his psychic abilities, but did not indicate whether this permission was a step towards abolishing the Decree altogether.{{Fn|6}} [[Khorarinn]], one of the [[Adeptus Custodes]], warned Garro that he considered the Decree to be fully in effect, and threatened that he would execute Rubio instantly if the Ultramarine used his abilities in Khorarinn's presence.{{Fn|10}} Later, the [[Dark Angels]] violated the Council's edicts when [[Lion El'Jonson]] used Librarians to battle [[Daemon]]s.{{Fn|11}}

Despite the Emperor's decision, in the aftermath of the [[Horus Heresy]] enforcement of Nikea ceased. By [[M41]], the choice of whether to have Librarians was left to individual chapters. The [[Salamanders]] explained to the [[Marines Malevolent]] that they felt Nikea was outdated, while the Marines Malevolent retained a healthy distrust of psykers and Warp-seers.{{Fn|7}} Within the archives of the [[Blood Ravens]], the title to this event is known as the Hearing of the Thousands. Furthermore, the [[Apocrypha of Haidyes]] was used during the Hearing which later became the maxim of the Blood Ravens [[Chapter]]. {{Fn|8}}

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
*The name, subject, and consequences of the Council of Nikaea have strong resemblance to the Roman [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea Council of Nicea] in 325 AD, which helped shape Catholic dogma.

The '''Council of Terra''' was an Imperial institution created in early [[M31]]{{Fn|1}} and lasting until [[Roboute Guilliman]] reformed the Imperium.{{Fn|2}}

== Overview ==
Created by the [[Emperor]] shortly after the [[Ullanor Crusade]], the Council was created as the governing body of the Imperium whilst the Emperor worked in the vaults of his palace: to attend to matters of state and would aim to create and uphold Imperial Law throughout the newly conquered Imperium, including the controversial [[Tithe|Imperial Tithe]].{{Fn|1}} The council had no military authority, which instead fell to the [[War Council]] under [[Warmaster]] [[Horus]].

It was superseded by the [[High Lords of Terra|Council of High Lords]] after the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|2}}

==Members of the Council of Terra==
*First Lord of the Council: [[Malcador (Character)|Malcador]]
*[[Fabricator-General]] of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus|Martian Mechanicum]]
**[[Kelbor-Hal]] (until the [[Schism of Mars]])
**[[Zagreus Kane]] (represented by ambassador [[Vethorel]])
*[[Captain-General]] [[Constantin Valdor]] of the [[Custodian Guard]]
*[[Master of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] â€” [[Nemo Zhi-Meng]]
*[[Master of the Administratum]]{{Fn|1}} [[Simion Pentasian]]{{fn|6}}
*[[Paternoval Envoy]] [[Bolam Haardiker]] of the [[Navis Nobilite]]{{Fn|4}}
*The two [[Lord Commander Militant]]s of the [[Imperial Army]]{{Fn|5}} â€” [[Tabor Ludovicia]] and [[Haldane Ma'lon]]. By the time of the [[Siege of Terra]] the Imperial Army was represented by a single Lord Commander Militant [[Adreen]]{{Fn|8}}
*[[Grand Provost Marshal]] [[Adeptus Arbites]] - [[Harr Rantal]] {{fn|6}}
*[[Master of the Astronomican]] - [[Cohran Hursula]]
*[[Chancellor of the Estate Imperium]] - [[Ossian (High Lord of Terra)|Ossian]] 
*[[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]] - [[Kelsi Demidov]]
*[[Chirurgeon-General]] of the [[Orders Hospitaller]] - [[Sidat Yaseen Tharcher]]{{Fn|7}}
*[[High Lord of the Imperial Chancellery]] - [[Jemm Marison]]{{Fn|8}}

==Controversy==
The Council of Terra attracted controversy during its time; from its inception, the [[Primarchs]] were deeply unhappy about being denied a place on the Council, after their position on the [[War Council]] which had been ruling the Imperium for the majority of the [[Great Crusade]]. This contributed to the feelings of abandonment in the Imperial military.{{Fn|1}}

The Imperial Tithe faced staunch opposition from the Warmaster himself, who felt it would cause unrest and even rebellion in some newly compliant or unstable areas of the Imperium.{{Fn|3}}

The Council was again beset by controversy during the Horus Heresy when [[Fabricator-General]] [[Kane]] and [[Mechanicum]] ambassador [[Vethorel]] attempted to give the loyalist Mechanicus a formal seat on the council. Many thought of this as a Mechanicus power-grab, but after a show of force by the [[Legio Ignatum]] and a threat by the [[Collegia Titanica]] to abandon Terra if their demands weren't meant, the Council of Terra relented.{{Fn|6}}

A '''Crusade''' is the [[Imperial]] term given for a very large-scale military campaign undertaken by Imperial forces in order to conquer several worlds in one offensive.  Crusades are usually broad enough in scope to involve several worlds and many smaller-scale campaigns.  They also often involve more than one branch of the Imperial military, in which case they are led by a [[Warmaster]] or an officer of sufficient rank to command multiple arms of the Imperial military.{{Cite this}}

==Overview==
Only the [[High Lords of Terra]] were able to declare a Crusade that could be any campaign from being a long, large-scale war involving many [[Space Marine]] [[Chapter]]s or could be a short conflict that is resolved in a single battle with only a handful of troops.  Crusades is one means of drawing contingents from several Space Marine Chapters and binding them together to fight an enemy.  This serves as a way of not committing entire Chapters or involving the ponderous resources of the [[Imperial Guard]].  They can be declared against heretic Lords or even rebellious planetary governments that had turned against the [[Imperium]] due to their own selfish reasons.  Crusades are also able to be launched against alien planets or newly discovered worlds that lay beyond the Emperor's light.{{Fn|1}}

To Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, the contribution of Space Marine forces is a matter of honour and can see a squad or two of troops deployed when they are called upon to take part in a Crusade.  Once won, the Chapter will add the battle honour to their standards as a mark of achievement and loyalty.  Entire Space Marine Chapters can take part in a Crusade as an act of penance for failure or due to incurring the displeasure of the Emperor.  Such acts are very extreme but are nonetheless willingly taken as completion means the Chapter earns the forgiveness of the Emperor thus allowing the Space Marines to return to their homeworld and be absolved of heresy.{{Fn|1}}

===Black Templars' Crusades===
[[Image:BTSymbol.jpg|thumb|right|100px|]]
The [[Black Templars]] [[chapter]] has been embarked on a single, neverending crusade since their founding, and their chapter is scattered across the galaxy in myriad smaller undertakings known as &quot;crusades&quot;.  A '''Crusade''' is the nominal unit of division among the Templars, instead of the more traditional [[Space Marine Company|Company]] in a [[Codex chapter]].{{Cite This}}

==History==
The first Crusade is considered to be the [[Emperor]]'s [[Great Crusade]] which created the Imperium.  The [[Chaos]] counterpart to an Imperial Crusade is known as a [[Black Crusade]].

After the [[Badab War]], the [[Executioners]] and [[Lamenters]] were dispatched on a hundred year Crusade in order to atone for their part in the rebellion.{{Fn|1}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a non-hostility treaty signed between the [[Imperium]] and the [[Tau Empire]] on the [[Sept World]] of [[Dal'yth]] after the ending of the [[Damocles Crusade]].{{Fn|1a}}

According to the [[Tau]], since its signing the Imperium has breached the treaty numerous times, by leading military operations into the territory held by the Empire. Despite this, the Tau Empire had been reluctant to antagonize the Imperium and would largely tolerate these infringements{{Fn|1a}}. It was not until the capture of the [[Ethereal]] [[Ko'vash]] from the colony world of [[Kuu'lan]]{{Fn|1b}} that this strategy would begin to change{{Fn|1a}}, two hundred years after the treaty's signing{{Fn|1b}}. After Ko'vash's successful rescue{{Fn|1a}} from the Imperium world of [[Dolumar IV]]{{Fn|1b}}, the [[Ethereal|Prime Ethereal]] [[Aun'Kathl'an]] and a council within the [[Aun't'au'retha]] allowed the Tau's military to retaliate against the hostile forces there, no longer willing to allow the Imperium's attacks go unanswered.{{Fn|1a}}

The '''Departmento Colonia''' is an [[Imperium]] organization that deals with establishing Imperial [[Colony World|colonies]] on worlds and also with sending military forces to defend the colonists. If contact is lost with these worlds, then the Departmento Colonia will send out requests to the Imperium's military organizations to check the status of the colonies.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Dernhelm 9th''' is an [[Imperium|Imperial]] unit known to have participated in the [[13th Black Crusade]].{{Fn|1}}

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
The name ''Dernhelm'' might have been inspired by the &quot;Dernhelm&quot; alias of Rohan Shieldmaiden [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89owyn Ã‰owyn], a character in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings Lord of the Rings]. 

==Note==
Though it would maybe be possible from the used nomenclature to conclude that the ''Dernhelm 9th'' is an [[Imperial Guard Regiment]] the source does not provide any details on the unit.

'''Desperados''' are a type of rogue killer and mercenary within the [[Imperium]].

Often simply refered to as '''Scum''' or '''[[Hive]] Scum''', Desperados are often renowned burglars, assassins, criminals, and infiltrators who have had many brushes with Imperial authorities. Due to possessing a wide variety of skills related to criminal or subversive activities, [[Inquisitor]]s will sometimes recruit Desperados (willing or otherwise) into their [[Inquisitorial Retinue|retinue]].{{Fn|1}}

The '''Dispensatus Anathema''' is an [[Imperial]] law that was created in [[M42]] which officially restored the [[Sisters of Silence]] into the hierarchy of the Imperium.{{Fn|1b}}
==History==
Before then, the [[Sisters of Silence|Sisters]] were a scattered exiled order. Each separate group, tried to secretly conduct the same duties they had before{{Fn|1b}} the Sisters were cast down in the aftermath of the [[Horus Heresy]]{{Fn|1a}}. They did so on their own, though, with no help from the [[Imperium]] and at the risk of being executed for being &quot;[[Psykers|witches]]&quot;. However when the reborn [[Primarch]] [[Guilliman]] became [[Lord Commander]], he moved to change the Sisters' status. Having remembered how their abilities as [[Blank]]s greatly aided the Imperium, during the [[Great Crusade]] and [[Horus Heresy]], Guilliman created the '''Dispensatus Anathema'''. It officially restored the Sisters of Silence into the hierarchy of the Imperium and they now answered to no one but the [[Emperor]]. The law gave them access to the Imperium's full support and the Sisters were allowed to begin freely recruiting new Blanks and create new [[Sisters of Silence Vigils|Vigils]]. In the [[Age of the Dark Imperium|new era]] the [[Great Rift]] created, the Lord Commander knew the Imperium would need the Sisters' skills now more than ever. The Dispensatus Anathema also had the benefit of making it harder, for their Imperial [[Ecclesiarchy|enemies]] to openly move against the Sisters.{{Fn|1b}}

{{Ambig|subject=the animal|disambiguation=Dog}}
'''Dogs''' are quadruped mammals native to [[Terra]] but encountered on several other worlds throughout the [[Imperium]]. They are popular domestic pets.{{Fn|1a}}

The [[Iron Snakes]] [[Space Marine Chapter]] is unique among the [[Adeptus Astartes]] in that they are trained to use dogs, whose senses are useful in tracking and flushing out [[Dark Eldar]].{{Fn|1b}}

Dogs are also genetically related to wolves. Hence, after the [[Burning of Prospero]], it was customary for [[Chaos Space Marines]] of the [[Thousand Sons]] [[Legion]] to refer to the [[Space Wolves]] as &quot;the Dogs.&quot;{{Fn|2}}

[[Image:Adeptus Ministorum Symbol.jpg|thumb|100px|right|'''Symbol of the Adeptus Ministorum'''{{Fn|4}}]]
The '''Ecclesiarchy''' (officially the '''Adeptus Ministorum''') is the official state church of the [[Imperium]]. {{Fn|1a}} It maintains and spreads the [[Imperial Cult]] throughout the Imperium.  Although the interpretation of particular Imperial Cult dogmas varies through the Imperium, any serious deviance from its strictures is considered [[heresy]] and dealt with extreme severity.  The Ecclesiarchy is based on [[Terra]], its urban palace covering nearly all of the southernmost continent.{{Fn|1c}}

==Organisation==
The Ecclesiarchy is not part of the [[Adeptus Terra]], but a wholly separate organisation.  At its head is the [[Ecclesiarch]], who, by tradition, is always one of the [[High Lords of Terra]].  Below him are the [[Cardinal]]s, of whom there are several thousand.  Below the Cardinals are the [[Ministorum Priest]]s: [[Bishop (Ecclesiarchy)|Bishop]]s{{Fn|18}}, [[Deacon]]s, [[Preacher|Pontifices]], [[Confessor]]s, [[Missionary|Missionaries]] and [[Preacher]]s.  Other specialist ranks and duties include [[Cenobite]]s, [[Relic-Keeper]]s, [[Drill Abbot]], [[Banisher]], and [[Chapel-Master]]s.{{Fn|11}}{{Fn|12}}{{Fn|1b}} A new senior rank, the [[Militant-Apostolic]], was recently created by [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|6}}

The Ministorum's ruling body is the [[Holy Synod]], comprised of the organisation's Cardinals.  The Ministorum in turn divides the Imperium into thousands of [[diocese]]s, each generally encompassing an entire Imperial world - an exception being Terra, which has several dioceses.  A diocese is further divided into '''parishes''' centered around a '''shrine'''.  Each diocese is headed by a Cardinal, while each parish is headed by a Preacher.  Ranking between these individuals are Pontifices whose authority extends over several parishes and preachers within a single diocese.{{Fn|1b}}

The Ministorum also includes an administrative bureaucracy, the [[Creed Temporal]], headed by [[Deacon|Arch-Deacons]], who control all secular business.  Arch-Deacons are the administrative counterparts to Cardinals, responsible for the temporal affairs of an entire diocese.  Their servants deal with the money entering and leaving a specific diocese or parish, regulate the construction of new shrines and temples and deal with the other physical requirements of the organisation.{{Fn|9b}}

The Ecclesiarchy directly rules several types of worlds of the [[Imperium]], most notably [[Shrine World]]s{{Fn|13}} and [[Cardinal World]]s.{{Fn|14}}

===Other Bodies===
[[Image:Adeptus Ministorum organization chart.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|Adeptus Ministorum Organization{{Fn|1b}}]]
====Adepta Sororitas====
{{Main|Adepta Sororitas}}
As the Ministorum's power has grown, a number of sub-organisations have developed within its compass.  An interesting example of this is the Adepta Sororitas, a penitent order of women.  The Sisterhood, as it is generally known, is expected to maintain a close watch on all servants and departments of the Imperium.{{Fn|2}} Its Militant Orders, the [[Sisters of Battle]], act as the military arm of the Ecclesiarchy.{{Fn|1c}}

====Missions====
*{{Main|Missionarius Galaxia}}
Missionary work is an important institution of the Ecclesiarchy; its purpose is to bring rediscovered [[human]] worlds into the fold of the Imperial cult.  For this purpose, Missionaries always accompany Imperial exploratory vessels in case human worlds are rediscovered.{{Fn|1g}}

Missionaries also run charitable Missions, which are schools or hospitals on newly discovered or primitive worlds.  When human worlds are rediscovered Missions are usually immediately established.  Part of the purpose of these Missions is to further the worship of the [[Emperor]] and Imperial ideals.  They are also vital in evaluating populations for signs of [[psychic]] and genetic [[mutation]].{{Fn|3}}

====Schola Progenium====
{{main|Schola Progenium}}
'''Schola Progenia''' are the orphanages run by the Ministorum specifically to raise and train the sons and daughters of Imperial servants who have given their lives in service.  The orphans receive a strict orthodox Imperial cult education, and soon come to regard the Emperor as their spiritual father.  Their upbringings will have made them loyal and devoted adherents to the Imperial cause and instilled in them a selfless ambition to serve the Imperium and humanity.  These qualities make them well suited to service in many of the organisations of the Imperium - the schools of the Schola Progenium providing a good portion of [[Imperial Guard]] and [[Imperial Navy|Navy]] officers, [[Commissar]]s, [[Assassin]]s, [[Adeptus Arbites|Arbitrator]]s and [[Inquisitor]]s. Female progena often enter the Adepta Sororitas.  Other progena become members of the Ministorum clergy.{{Fn|1f}}

====Known Sects====
*[[Cult of the Immaculate Designâ€Ž]]{{Fn|21}}
[[Image:The Ecclesiarchy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ecclesiarchy Priests{{Fn|9a}}]]
===Armed Forces===
====Sisters of Battle====
{{Main|Orders Militant}}
The '''Sisters of Battle''' act as armed wing of the [[Adepta Sororitas]] and the current standing army of the Ecclesiarchy.{{Fn|1c}}

====Frateris Templar====
{{main|Frateris Templar}}
The '''Frateris Templar''' were the original, all-male army of [[Goge Vandire]].  They were destroyed by a [[Warp storm]] while en route to [[Dimmamar]] to pacify the rebellious Confederation of Light.  The storm became known as the [[Storm of the Emperor's Wrath]].  They have since been disbanded, and their roles have been assumed by the Sisters of Battle.{{Fn|1c}}

====Frateris Militia====
{{main|Frateris Militia}}
The unofficial armies of the Ministorum, the religiously-motivated '''Frateris''' fight wars of faith against the enemies of the Imperium.{{Fn|1b}}

====Fleet====
The Adeptus Ministorum is known to operate its own naval vessels. These include [[Missionary Ship]]s.{{Fn|7}} Individual [[Cardinal]]s are also known to operate [[Cruiser]]-class vessels.{{Fn|9}}

====Other====
The Ecclesiarchy maintains a variety of types of miscellaneous warriors, such as [[Crusader]]s{{Fn|20}}, [[Black Priests]]{{Fn|19}}, [[Death Cult Assassin]]s{{Fn|20}}, and [[Arco-Flagellant]]s.{{Fn|10b}}

==History==
===Origins===
During the [[Great Crusade]], many different cults appeared throughout the Imperium worshiping the Emperor as a god, each with their own subtle variations and differences.  These forms of worship appeared first in those primitive planets that had strongly regressed during the [[Age of Strife]]. This culminated in the worship of the Emperor as a god by the [[Word Bearers]], resulting in the authoring of the [[Lectitio Divinitatus]] by [[Lorgar]]. Despite the Emperor's ban on worship, the cults continued on in secret by such figures as [[Euphrati Keeler]], [[Kyril Sindermann]], and the [[Lightbearers]]{{Fn|8}}. The numbers of these cults multiplied immensely with the Emperor's ultimate sacrifice to mankind and subsequent incarceration upon the [[Golden Throne]].  Most of these cults would gradually fade away, while others prospered, eventually absorbing the weaker ones.  The more successful ones spread their forms of worship to other planets.{{Fn|1a}}

The strongest of all of them was the [[Temple of the Saviour Emperor]].  This cult had the advantages that it was based on Terra, and that its leader had been a successful and respected officer of the [[Imperial Army]] who had fought at the [[Battle of Terra]], defending the [[Imperial Palace]].  This leader had re-named himself as [[Fatidicus]] and had begun to preach his teachings to anyone who would listen.  This faith spread among the members of the [[Imperial Guard]] and [[Imperial Navy|Navy]], but also to lowly scribes and minor adepts of the [[Adeptus Terra]].  The faith was spread by these individuals to other planets.  When Fatidicus died at the age of 120, the Temple had more than a billion followers on Terra and untold numbers of the faithful throughout the [[Segmentum Solar]].{{Fn|1a}}

In the wake of the chaos and anarchy of the [[Horus Heresy]], the Temple of the Saviour Emperor provided a message of reunification through a common faith.  Cults who rejected being absorbed, or who couldn't be absorbed, saw themselves being persecuted by fanatical mobs.  Officially, the Temple rejected this violence performed in its name.  This development culminated in [[M32]] as almost two-thirds of the Imperium followed the teachings of the Temple, the exceptions being the [[Space Marines]] and the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]], who had their own form of worship.  The Temple's importance, influence, and power rapidly outmatched any other Imperial cult.{{Fn|1a}}

===The Adeptus Ministorum===
In the early [[M32|32nd millennium]] the Temple became the state religion of the Imperium.  It also became an official organisation of the Imperium as the '''Adeptus Ministorum'''.  A few centuries later [[Ecclesiarch]] [[Veneris II]] received a seat amongst the High Lords of Terra, and after 300 years this seat was made permanent.  The power of the Ecclesiarchy continued to grow, increasing its hold over the Imperial citizenry.  Those who would not follow its teachings were declared unbelievers, ostracised, and on occasion even executed.  The vast territories of the Imperium were organised in dioceses led by Cardinals.  These powerful figures were responsible for Missionaries and Preachers on hundreds of worlds.  Lavish shrines, impressive temples, and majestic cathedrals were built throughout the Imperium.{{Fn|1a}}

===The Confederation of Light===
The only threat to the Ecclesiarchy was the [[Confederation of Light]].  Based upon the planet [[Dimmamar]], this penitent faith's ideals of poverty and humble living clearly contradicted the teachings of the Ecclesiarchy, whose view was that sacrifices of wealth and money were for the citizens.  The Confederation was too difficult to infiltrate, and the Ecclesiarchy turned to violence, supported with the unanimous vote of the Senate of the High Lords of Terra, declaring the first [[War of Faith]].  The entire Confederation was declared heretical and the forces of the Imperial Guard, the Imperial Navy, and thousands of fanatical zealots were unleashed upon it, bent on its destruction.  Only a few cells and hidden shrines of the Confederation managed to survive and the power of the Ecclesiarchy was made complete.{{Fn|1c}}

===The War of the Beast===
During the [[War of the Beast]] in mid-[[M32]], the Ecclesiarchy was overseen by Ecclesiarch [[Mesring]], who went mad as the conflict ground on. After he pledged allegiance to [[The Beast]], the Ecclesiarch was executed by [[Lord Commander of the Imperium]] [[Koorland]]. Koorland went on to strip the Ecclesiarchy of its seat on the [[Senatorum Imperialis]] and revoked their [[Tithe]] privileges.{{Fn|5}} However Koorland ultimately met his end on [[Ullanor]]{{Fn|16}}, and following [[The Beheading]] his reforms were undone. The Ecclesiarchy regained its seat on the Senatorum Imperialis during the reign of [[Drakan Vangorich]].{{Fn|15}}

At the end of the [[M33|33rd millennium]] every Imperial world was furnished with its own cathedral and the coffers of the Ecclesiarchy were filled with the offerings and tithes of billions of faithful.  This wealth was squandered in building more and more larger and lavish temples and to fund more Wars of Faith to secure the Ecclesiarchy's power.{{citethis}}

===Age of Apostasy===
{{main|Age of Apostasy}}
The '''Apostasy''' was one of the most destabilising events in Imperial history after the Heresy, beginning during the long struggle between the Ecclesiarchy and the Administratum for power over the Imperium.  [[Goge Vandire]], the 361st [[Master of the Administratum]], was a power-hungry tyrant, eventually gaining direct control over the Ecclesiarchy by usurping the position of the Ecclesiarch.  This made him the most powerful individual in the Imperium.  His rule became known as '''The Reign of Blood''', consisting of massive purges of the Ecclesiarchy, and the killings and assassinations of countless perceived traitors and conspirators.  This period was eventually ended by [[Sebastian Thor]]'s [[Confederation of Light]].  The Apostasy resulted in a reformation of the Ecclesiarchy, including the [[Decree Passive]] which banned the Ministorum from maintaining men under arms. Some time between M36 and M41, the Ecclesiarchy circumvented this by raising the [[Sisters of Battle]].{{Fn|10a}}

===The Plague of Unbelief===
{{Main|Plague of Unbelief}}

The '''Plague of Unbelief''' is considered part of the Age of Apostasy, although occurring several decades after Sebastian Thor's ascension to the position of Ecclesiarch.  The main perpetrator of the Plague of Unbelief was [[Cardinal Bucharis]].{{Fn|1d}}

===Dark Imperium===
*{{Main|Age of the Dark Imperium}}
The return of the [[Primarch]] [[Roboute Guilliman]] and his subsequent seizure of power in the Imperium proved a difficult issue for the Ecclesiarchy. The Ministorum frequently venerated [[Imperial Regent|Regent]] Guilliman as a god, a role he spurned. At the same time, Guilliman often displayed the belief that the Emperor was not divine, seemingly contradicting the entire Imperial Cult. However Guilliman recognized the need of the Ecclesiarchy to maintain the Imperium's authority and unity on its million worlds, and as a result created the rank of [[Militant-Apostolic]] to both better coordinate with the church and allay their fears that Guilliman may attempt to undermine their power.{{Fn|6}} However Guilliman is still cautious of the Ministorum's agenda, and carefully monitors their activities and plans.{{Fn|6a}}

{{otheruses|USE=[[Terra]]n edict|OTHERUSE=[[Chaos]] warship|OTHERPAGE=Damnatio Memorae}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''', or '''Damnatio Memoriae''' in [[High Gothic]], is an [[Imperial]] policy regarding historical censorship.{{Fn|1}}

Declared by the [[High Lords of Terra]] against [[Heretic]]s deemed too dangerous to be known or remembered, an Edict of Obliteration involves erasing the very presence of the individual from history and society as if they had never existed. Carried out by the [[Inquisition]], all knowledge of the individual and their actions are thereafter classified and known only to the higher officials of Imperial power. Notable figures who have been subjected to an Edict of Obliteration have been [[Lufgt Huron]] and the [[Daemon Primarch]]s.{{Fn|1}}

The Edict of Obliteration can sometimes be applied to entire historical events, such as the [[Badab War]] and [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1}}

'''Enforcers''' are an [[Imperial]] [[Planetary Governor]]'s heavily armed security forces, that are charged with maintaining law and order on their Homeworld.{{Fn|1}}

They will rarely act in the pursuit of justice though and are far more often an extension of their Governor's will. In order to keep the Imperium's grip on a world secure, Enforcers will discipline, capture and execute those who go against the Governor's proclamations, using a heavy hand to crush any rebellions or seditious elements they learn of. They are distinct and separate from the forces of the [[Adeptus Arbites]], however, who are concerned with any violations of the [[Lex Imperialis]]. Enforcers, meanwhile, only have as much authority as they are granted by their [[Planetary Governor]].{{Fn|1}}

The [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] have their own version of Enforcers, known as the [[Astynomia]].{{Fn|2}}

==Known Enforcer Security Forces==
*The [[Palanite Enforcers]] of the [[Hive World]] [[Necromunda]]
*The [[Praecental Guard]] of [[Ultramar]].
*The [[Varangantuan Enforcersâ€Ž]] of the [[Hive World]] [[Alecto (Hive World)|Alecto]]
*The [[Astynomia]] of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]]
*The [[Hyperezia]] of [[Legio Metalica]]

'''Extraction Rigs''' are massive [[Imperial]] structures, that are used to harvest various natural resources from beneath a world's surface. These resources will then be transferred elsewhere across the world's surface, through fuel pipes.{{Fn|1}} 

One such resource is [[Promethium]], which can cause Extraction Rigs to emit smoke clouds, noxious fumes or charged fumes. Noxious fumes are toxic and can lead to acidic fallout, while charged fumes can cause an ionized atmosphere, that will prevent any communication equipment from working.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Feast of the Primarch's Rebirth''' is a recently created [[Imperial]] celebration, that honors the return of the reborn [[Primarch]] [[Roboute Guilliman]] to the Imperium. It is traditional to commemorate this celebration with fasting, ruthless self-flagellation, and marathon [[Ecclesiarchy]] litany sessions.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Festival of the Heart''' is an [[Imperial]] festival, that is rumored to date back to old [[Terra]].{{Fn|1}} 

Little is known about this tradition, except that it involves greeting each other with Happy Festival of the Heart, knowing the precise anatomical location of the heart and some notions of fraternity. Because of this, the [[Astra Militarum]] produces motivational cards along these lines, so that [[Guardsmen]] can give them to each other, their [[Commissar]]s and the enemies of the Imperium.{{Fn|1}}

==Trivia==
The Festival of the Heart is an in-universe equivalent of Valentine's Day.{{Fn|1}}

'''The Forging''' is also known as the '''Golden Age of the Imperium'''.{{Fn|1}}

During this period the [[Adeptus Terra]] brought the most important systems under its control and expanded the borders of the [[Imperium]].  Internal stability was gained with the establishment of [[Astropathic Choir]]s on countless worlds and the discovery of valuable [[Standard Template Construct]]s from the [[Dark Age of Technology]].{{Fn|1}}

Just like during the [[Great Crusade]] the Imperium expunged the forces of Chaos and [[Xenos]] alike in the galaxy and reclaimed lost regions.{{Fn|1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2499">'''Gangs''' are violent, territorial groups that can be found throughout the [[Imperium]]. [[Hive World]]s are known for their extensive amount of gangs. Even [[Terra]] has a huge number of gangs formed from the destitute non-adept population.

Hive world gangs are often part of the powerful rival families or clans of the hives. Some gangs (known as brat gangs) are from the young nobility of hive world cities, which descend to attack the lower-level gangs. Powerful lower level gangs are sometimes legitimized by the [[Planetary Governor|Planetary Government]] as the hive world's [[PDF|planetary defense forces]], in order to keep down the most anarchic elements, and even to defend the planet if it is attacked. From there they may be recruited into the [[Imperial Guard]].

Hive gangs often assume a name reflecting whatever they identify themselves with, such their territory, environment or fighting style. On the hive world of [[Tellus]], for instance, gangs were recorded as having names such as the &quot;Bad Rad Boys&quot;, the &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;, the &quot;Screaming Scabs&quot; and the &quot;Zeta Death Phalangites&quot;.{{Fn|2}}

'''Ghost Ships'''{{Fn|1}}, or also known as '''Ghost Vessels'''{{Fn|2}}, is the [[Imperial]] term for spacecraft that were thought lost, but somehow appear in [[Realspace]] for brief moments. This can occur both visually and on [[Auspex]] equipment, which are known as '''Auspex Phantoms'''.{{Fn|1}}

The term also applies to spacecraft that have been found abandoned and drifting through space. Sometimes this is for obvious reasons, such as their crews being killed during a boarding attack.{{Fn|2}}

The '''God Incarnate''' is a controversial ideology that theorizes the means by which the [[Emperor]] could be born once more.{{Fn|1}}

==Overview==
Those who advocate the God Incarnate believe that the Emperor is a god, and like the other gods He exists within the [[Warp]]. They believe that just as a man such as the Emperor could become a god, it stands to reason that a god could become a man. This is the central idea of the God-Incarnate, the physical vessel for a God in the material world. These physical vessels, referred to by [[Thorians]] as '''Divine Avatars''', would be special individuals who would become a host for the Emperor's consciousness in the Warp.{{Fn|1}}

The myths and legends surrounding the God-Incarnate tell of the coming of the Divine Avatar(s) amid a time of great upheaval and war. Moreover, the Divine Avatar will possess unique traits such as phenomenal [[psychic]] power, an &quot;altered&quot; form, and the ability to talk to animals. Some within the [[Inquisition]] believe that the [[End Times]] represent this final period where the God Incarnate will finally be made manifest.{{Fn|1}}

==Status==
The principles of the God Incarnate are outlawed by the [[Inquisition]], for they fear that if the Emperor were to be reborn, the [[Astronomican]] might fail, the Divine Avatar might be corrupted by [[Chaos]], and civil war between believers and unbelievers would erupt. Moreover, the Emperor could be killed again, potentially taking the Emperor's essence with it. Thus some within the Inquisition have made it their duty to seek out possible Divine Avatars and either kill them or study them.{{Fn|1}}

Meanwhile, the [[Magi]] are also seeking out Divine Avatars, except in their case they wish to prevent the second coming of the Emperor or perhaps use these mortal vessels to instead bring a [[Chaos God]] into the material universe.{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:EmperorAstartes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Emperor with his [[Space Marine]]s{{Fn|2}}]]
The '''Great Crusade''' (~798.[[M30]] â€” 005.[[M31]]{{Fn|1}}) was a brief age of rebuilding and reunification following the complete regression of mankind during the [[Age of Strife]]. It was a time when the [[Emperor]] still lived in the conventional sense and led his race in person. It followed the Emperor's conquest of Terra in the [[Unification Wars]] and lasted roughly from the [[First Pacification of Luna|conquest of Earth's moon]] to the [[Battle of Isstvan III]] and the beginning of the [[Horus Heresy]].

==The Early Crusade==
Part of the Emperor's vision of human unification was the [[Primarch Project]], meant to be the creation of 20 superhumans to lead the [[Emperor]]'s forces to reclaim the [[galaxy]] in his name. It also saw the creation of the [[Space Marine Legions]] from the [[gene-seed]] samples that survived the scattering of the [[Primarch]]s by the [[Gods of Chaos|Chaos gods]]. These forces would play the major role in the upcoming Great Crusade alongside the [[Imperial Army]], [[Titan Legion]]s, [[Legio Cybernetica]], [[Sisters of Silence]], and [[Custodian Guard]].{{cite this}}

The subsiding of the warp storms plaguing much of the galaxy coincided with the end of the Age of Strife. With warp travel feasible again, the Emperor was able to begin the Great Crusade which would create the Imperium. Even before the warp storms and the Age of Strife had ended, the Emperor had begun to make plans for the Great Crusade. These plans included the creation of a far more advanced form of power armour required for the conditions of deep space and alien worlds{{Fn|1}}.

After securing [[Luna]] and then [[Mars]], he began a great building project, reconstructing the industries and production facilities he would need to construct and maintain a great space fleet, sufficient to carry his legions all the way to the edges of the galaxy. Mars, due to its advanced technology and manufacturing infrastructure, became the center of this development, producing, along with ships, the arms and armor his warriors would be equipped with{{Fn|1}}. [[Saturn]], [[Neptune]], and [[Jupiter]] fell to the Emperor next, its inhabitants liberated from cruel alien overlords. Finally, the Imperial War Fleet broke out of the [[Sol System]] system after completely annihilating the &quot;false world&quot; of [[Sedna]].{{Fn|7a}}

==The Crusade begins==
[[Image:EmperorwLegions.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Emperor and his Space Marines]]
His fleet constructed, he forged out into the depths of space, seeking out his Primarchs and spreading the name of the Emperor. Throughout the following millennium, he gradually reclaimed his Primarchs, and slowly united humanity under the [[Pax Imperialis]]. World after world fell to the Emperor's forces, at first the [[Legio Astartes]] and [[Custodian Guard]] and later the [[Imperial Army]], [[Sisters of Silence]], [[Collegia Titanica]], [[Legio Cybernetica]], and others. Tyrants and false-rulers of thousands of worlds were overthrown by Imperial forces, who quickly outlawed religion and dogma by decree of the Emperor himself. [[Ork]]s, [[Eldar]], [[Hrud]], [[Slaugth]], hideous [[Warp]] entities, and many other lesser alien races were all defeated and driven back in a seemingly unstoppable tide of conquest. Worlds whose human population had become too corrupted or mutated were simply exterminated from orbit.{{Fn|7a}}

In the early stages of the Crusade, the Imperial forces were divided into three main thrusts, one commanded by [[Horus]], the other by [[Ferrus Manus]], and the last by the [[Emperor]] himself.{{Fn|8}} As each Primarch was discovered, he was given control of his own Legion of Space Marines. As more of the Empire was carved, the Emperor's forces were spread more and more thinly. Eventually the need for Space Marines was greater than the supply. As such, Accelerated Gene Culturing was necessary to provide sufficient legions. Unfortunately, this process was unstable and led to flaws in the gene seed of the legions. This would lead to such afflictions as the [[Red Thirst]] and various mutations in the [[Space Wolf]] gene seed.{{cite this}}

The Crusade lasted for around two hundred years. At its peak, it had over 4,300 [[Expeditionary Fleet]]s involved in galactic conquest. The Great Crusade reached its apex with the great victory by [[Horus]] against a massive [[Waaagh!]] of [[Orks]] in the [[Ullanor Crusade]]. After this victory the Emperor declared Horus [[Warmaster]], or acting Supreme Commander in his stead. Having seen most of humanity reunited the Emperor returned to Terra, where he began his [[Webway Project|secret project]].{{Fn|5}}

Towards the Great Crusade's end came a period of political consolidation. The Legions were at this point dispersed across the galaxy, many acting as garrison forces rather than campaigning armies. The Legions had been battling constantly, especially the [[Iron Warriors]], struggling under the monotony of siege warfare and garrison duties. A large [[Administratum|bureaucracy]] overseen by [[Malcador (Character)|Malcador]] and the [[Council of Terra]] formed to manage the newly conquered territories. This bureaucracy often clashed with the Astartes military established, and tensions began to run high when it became apparent that the Emperor intended to have Malcador's Terran Council rule over the nascent Imperium and not the Legiones Astartes.{{Fn|5}}

Also, without the Emperor's guidance the Primarchs that had previously friendly rivalries were beginning to develop into dangerous feuds. Some of the Primarchs had reached the point of intolerance with one another, others like [[Magnus the Red]] had simply become isolated in the confusion of the Great Crusade. Already the [[Word Bearers]] Primarch [[Lorgar]] had secretly turned against the [[Emperor]] decades before the Crusades end after the destruction of his &quot;perfect city&quot; of [[Monarchia]] by the [[Ultramarines]]. Meanwhile [[Leman Russ (Primarch)|Leman Russ]] clashed with both [[Angron]] and [[Lion El'Jonson]]. [[Perturabo]] was shunned by most due to the nature of his hand in the Crusade and was in turn envious of [[Rogal Dorn]]. [[Konrad Curze]] also had a disagreement with Dorn that escalated into a brutal surprise attack that left Dorn badly injured and unconscious. This mistrust and hatred would form the linchpin of the [[Horus Heresy]].{{cite this}}

==The End of the Crusade==
*{{Main|Horus Heresy}}
The age of the Great Crusade ended with the virus bombing of [[Isstvan III]] by [[Warmaster]] [[Horus]], which announced the beginning of his [[Horus Heresy|Rebellion]]. The loyalist legions were recalled to Terra to defend against the traitor Warmaster, but not all of the Legions were able to return. The [[Ultramarines]] were mired in the Ultramar system fighting [[Kor Phaeron]] and his retinue of [[Word Bearers]] that had come to destroy them. The [[Space Wolves]] were finishing their battle at Prospero with the now openly traitorous [[Thousand Sons]], the [[White Scars]] were mired in the [[Chondax Campaign]], and the [[Dark Angels]] were in the midst of a civil war on Caliban and a slow campaign against the [[Gordian League]].{{cite this}}

In many ways the Emperor was now gone, The Imperium suddenly finding itself without the great leadership of the Guardian of Mankind. The brief age of recovery which the Great Crusade represented was over, and mankind began to decline into the state it is now, with fear and chaos rife, [[Inquisitor]]s seeking out heresy at every corner and billions of people living in forced, and willing, slavery to their God-Emperor.{{cite this}}

[[Eldar]] forces consisting of six entire [[Craftworld]]s appeared in the [[Argos System]] and vanished with a mysterious swirling celestial phenomenon previously seen in the area.  The event extinguished all suns within sixty light years, threatening [[human]] worlds. The [[Imperial Fleet]], [[Imperial Navy]], and other innumerable transports undertook a vast evacuation of the System, transporting billions of citizens and infrastructure. It is estimated that 12% of the population and 32% of the heavy industry in the System were safely transported. The ring of dead planets has since become known as the [[Deadhenge]], a salvager's paradise and refuge for pirates.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Great Scouring''' was the [[Imperium]]'s counter-offensive against the rebel armies of [[Horus]], following the defeat of the [[Horus Heresy]] in c.[[M31]]{{Fn|1}}. [[Horus]]'s campaign to strike towards [[Terra]] to achieve a quick and decisive victory had ultimately been defeated. The rebels were broken and in retreat, and Imperial forces now had the job of reacquiring all the territory they had captured. The Great Scouring saw the first mass galaxy-wide purge carried out by the Imperium as it sought to erase the taint of Horus' treachery from its realm.{{Fn|1}}

==Overview==
Before actually being confined within the [[Golden Throne]], the [[Emperor]] had pronounced judgment on the rebels: they were to be driven into the hellish region of the [[Eye of Terror]], which would hold them for all eternity. All records and memory of the [[Traitor Legion]]s were to be expunged from the Imperial archives. Worlds such as [[Isstvan V]] and [[Davin]] would be scoured and the Traitors' associated troops were to be destroyed or driven into the Eye. It would be as if the Traitor Legions never existed. Meanwhile since the death of Horus, the Traitor Legions had become splintered and dispersed.{{Fn|4}}

Fighting continued for another seven years before the rebels were wholly destroyed or exiled. The Imperium fought not only the traitors but also [[Xenos]] that had taken advantage of the turmoil caused by the Heresy to plunder human worlds. Systems once thought unassailable to the Xenos threat were put under siege. During the campaign, loyalist forces realized the sheer scale of [[Chaos]] influence in the Imperium as world after world was discovered to have traitor presence.{{Fn|3}} Many corrupted systems were cleansed and placed under the watch of the Inquisition. Horus's death had not ended the fighting, it had renewed the loyalists against the rebels. Many worlds during the Heresy had refused to commit their forces to either side, or seceded entirely. Such indecision was punished by loyalist and rebel alike. These forces were bled white attacking rebel strongholds. Meanwhile, the Legions destroyed at the [[Drop Site Massacre]] were slowly reestablished using what little gene-seed the survivors had managed to escape with.{{Fn|2}}

With the Emperor confined to the Golden Throne and the Imperium leaderless but loosely organized under [[Roboute Guilliman]], the forces of [[Chaos]] and all of the enemies of the Imperium swept down on the defenceless worlds which had been ravaged by the fighting during the Heresy. The light of the [[Great Crusade]] was gone to be replaced by a dark time in which death was far more prevalent and hope seemed far away. The forces of the Imperium were reorganised and redeployed and gradually the followers of Chaos were forced to flee west to the Eye of Terror. Eventually the Imperium succeeded in stabilising itself, but not without heavy losses of men and machinery.{{Cite this}}

The [[Ultramarines]] were a major factor in the success of the Imperium owing to their not taking part in the [[Siege of Terra]] due to fighting in the galactic east. [[Roboute Guilliman]] was the greatest military strategist alive and rallied the other [[Space Marine Legions]] to act as a bulwark against all enemies of the Imperium. The days following the Heresy were to be some of the darkest seen since the Emperor rose to power. Guilliman was said to have been everywhere during this period, rallying forces and reinforcing them with his Ultramarines before moving on to the next battle zone. Never once did the Space Marines take a step back, so strong was their faith in the Imperium and Guilliman's tactics.{{Cite this}}

During the Scouring, great political changes were introduced into the Imperium, primarily overseen by Guilliman. The most significant of these was breaking apart the Space Marine Legions into [[Chapter]]s as well as dividing the [[Imperial Army]] into the [[Imperial Guard]] and [[Imperial Navy]]. Both of these measures were intended to curb the power that any single man could wield in the Imperium, limiting the damage if another rebellion broke out.{{Fn|4}}

The Great Scouring was followed by the period known as the [[Age of Rebirth]].{{Fn|1}}

'''Guilders''' are representatives of a [[Merchant Guild]] that operates inside a [[Hive]]. They are often recognized by the large icons of their guild that they carry around their necks. These icons are used as keys, both visually and electronically. If a Hiver sees the icon they will often allow the Guilder to pass them. They are imprinted with numerous security codes that allow them to open most electronically locked doors. The larger and more ornate a Guilder's icon, the higher rank they have obtained within the guild.{{Cite This}}

Guilders often have diplomatic immunity within the hives, moving around between the Houses without any trouble whatsoever. They coordinate trade between the houses, and manage the trafficking of weapons and ammunition around the [[Hive]].{{Cite This}}

==Other Uses of Term==
'''Guilder''' is also an informal name for any member of an industrial cartel on [[Pavonis]].{{Fn|1}}

'''Heart Day''' is an ancient [[Terran]] custom, that is celebrated by the [[Imperium]] and the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] as well.{{Fn|1}} 

According to [[Imperial]] historical records, it was a mysterious festival where [[Terran]] citizens signaled their compatibility by displaying gifts fashioned after the hearts of powerful foes they had presumably defeated. In modern times, Heart Day is celebrated within the [[Astra Militarum]] by allowing [[Guardsmen]] to hand out motivational cards, that represent their willingness to fight and die alongside each other.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Heliosicon Tower''' was during the [[Horus Heresy]] one of the tallest structures of the [[Imperial Palace]] of the [[Emperor]]. It got its name from the views it commanded of the Terran sun when it rose over the atmospheric pollution in [[M30]]. It had a bulbous minaret at the top, housing not only facilities but also crenellated terraces outfitted both for observation as well as maintaining interceptor missile launchers.{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:Excommunicatetraitoris.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The stamp of ''[[Excommunicate Traitoris]]'', the ultimate condemnation of Heresy{{Fn|15}}]]
Within the [[Imperium of Man]], '''Heresy''' is any action or opinion which is seen as contrary to the interests of the Imperial regime or its teachings. Due to the theocratic nature of the Imperium Heresy is often a political charge alongside a religious one.{{Fn|1}} In practice, all enemies of the Imperium are invariably labeled '''Heretics'''. In the Imperium, the most common sentence for heresy is death.{{Fn|2}}

==Overview==
Heresy within the Imperium may take many forms. These include deviations from the established [[Imperial Cult]], to denying the rights and rule of the [[Adeptus Terra]], to collaboration or association with [[Xenos]] and [[Mutant]]s, to open dissent or rebellion. The most serious acts of Heresy are reserved for those who associate with the Dark Gods of [[Chaos]]. Formal declarations of Heresy or of Heretics can come from a variety of sources, but the most common is that of the [[Ecclesiarchy]].{{Fn|2}} Nonetheless, often the accusation of Heresy in the Imperium used as a weapon by those wishing to gain power over others. Moreover, as the Imperium is a vast realm with countless different cultures and traditions, what is considered Heretical to one world may be perfectly acceptable to another. This makes the persecution of Heresy a delicate affair.{{Fn|1}}

===Types of Heresy===
====Rebellion====
The act of simply defying the Imperium or its [[Adept]]a is often decried as Heresy. Rebellion in the Imperium can take many forms, from a desire to free oneself from the Imperial yoke to conversion to [[Chaos]]. While often all types of rebels are branded heretics, wiser and more experienced [[Inquisitor]]s are able to discern legitimate greivances from malicious corruption and avoid unnecessary purges.{{Fn|2}}

====Bodily Heresy====
*{{Main|Mutant}}
The Ecclesiarchy condemns non-sanctioned forms of [[Mutant|mutation]] to be acts of Heresy. Mutant represents deviation from the physical norm and a potential taint of Chaos, and mutants are often viciously persecuted on Imperial worlds. However more experienced Inquisitors will often ignore simple mutants, seeing their extermination as a waste of time and resources.{{Fn|3}} Instead, they focus their attention on truly threatening mutant bands that may associate with the likes of [[Chaos Cult]]s{{Fn|4}} or [[Genestealer Cult]]s.{{Fn|5}}

====Witchcraft====
*{{Main|Psyker}}
The &quot;Witch&quot; is a superstitious term often labeled against unsanctioned [[Psyker]]s that may be discovered within Imperial society. Imperial citizenry is routinely lectured on the threat of the Psyker and the need to report their presence to Imperial authorities. The Witch is seen as a threat far greater than any mutant or common heretic, embodying a constant threat to the souls and lives of all around them. Left unchecked, a Psyker could potentially devastate an entire world. Imperial Psykers are thus heavily controlled and usually collected by the [[League of Blackships]]. Those [[Rogue Psyker]]s that may exist are the frequent target of the [[Ordo Hereticus]].{{Fn|3}}

====Xenophilic Heresy====
*{{Main|Xenos}}
Xenophilia, or association with [[Xenos]], is strictly forbidden by the common citizens of the Imperium and is seen as a severe act of Heresy. The Imperial Creed has declared all aliens as filthy and debased, worthy only of extermination. Collaboration with Xenos will often bring swift death to all involved. Nonetheless, many worlds on the frontiers of the Imperium often have contacts with Xenos and in some cases share their worlds with such beings.{{Fn|1}} Moreover, [[Rogue Trader]]s make frequent contacts with Xenos and species of the [[Kroot]] have even served as Imperial [[Mercenaries]]. Such activity is frowned upon by the Ecclesiarchy, but can be tolerated depending on the context.{{Fn|1}}

====Religious Heresy====
Often simply dubbed &quot;true Heresy&quot;, this is perhaps the most serious of all charges within the Imperium. Religious Heresy involves denying the divinity of the Imperium and worst of all association with the [[Ruinious Powers]] of [[Chaos]].{{Fn|1}} Religious heretics will often form [[Cult]]s to coordinate their activities and spread their beliefs. These Cults represent an enormous threat to stability of Imperial worlds and can be the heralds of [[Chaos Space Marine]]{{Fn|4}} or [[Xenos]] invasion.{{Fn|5}}

The declaration of religious Heresy is a delicate matter and often left to [[Cardinal]]s and [[Missionaries]].{{Fn|2}} Large-scale deviation from the Imperial Cult can be tolerated, most notably by the [[Cult Mechanicus]] of the [[Mechanicum]]{{Fn|12}} and the [[Chapter]] Cults of the [[Adeptus Astartes]].{{Fn|13}}

====Techno-Heresy====
*{{Main|Heretek}}
Techno-Heresy is a charge leveled by the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] upon those which may deviate from its technological and scientific teachings. This is seen as a betrayal of the [[Cult Mechanicus]]. Techno-Heresy comes in many forms, such weakening the Adeptus' stranglehold on the knowledge of the Imperium's technology, or embracing individual experimentation and innovation.{{Fn|9}}

==Combating Heresy==
The Imperial regime has multiple bodies dedicated to quashing Heresy. These include the [[Adeptus Arbites]], which enforce the [[Lex Imperialis]] across the worlds of the Imperium.{{Fn|6}} The [[Adeptus Ministorum]] devotes a large part of its efforts in determining what qualifies as Heresy and condemning heretics wherever they may be discovered.{{Fn|1}} During a [[War of Faith]], Imperial armies will often exterminate massive numbers Heretics. Most zealous in these purges are the [[Sisters of Battle]], the militant arm of the Ecclesiarchy.{{Fn|1}} 

But the most sinister of all is the [[Inquisition]] and more specifically the [[Ordo Hereticus]], which has made it its mission to eliminate the heretic.{{Fn|2}} The [[Ordo Xenos]] is often tasked with combating xenophilic acts of Heresy{{Fn|14}} while the [[Ordo Malleus]] will sometimes exterminate the most dangerous of all Chaos Cults. In some cases, the dreaded [[Officio Assassinorum]]{{Fn|7}} or even the [[Adeptus Custodes]]{{Fn|8}} have brought their wrath down upon suspected heretics.

For combating Techno-Heresy, the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] maintains its own secret police force known as the [[Prefecture Magisterium]]. This agency operates hunter-killer clades with brutally deal with suspected [[Heretek]]s.{{Fn|10}}

The '''Hexarchy''' was a group composed of both current and deposed [[High Lords]], who refused to accept the reforms [[Lord Commander]] [[Roboute Guilliman]] imposed upon the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1a}} 

They were led by [[Irthu Haemotalion]], the former [[Master of the Administratum]] who had been dismissed by [[Guilliman]], and also included the deposed [[Baldo Slyst]] and the current [[High Lords]] [[Aveliza Drachmar]], [[Mar Av Ashariel]], [[Merelda Pereth]] and [[Fadix]]. Using their vast resources, the Hexarchy attempted to forcibly take control of [[Terra]], while [[Lord Commander]] Guilliman was away conducting the [[Indomitus Crusade]]. Once Terra was theirs, the Hexarchy would then have command of the [[Imperium]] and would undo Guilliman's changes{{Fn|1b}}, ensuring [[Imperium Eterna]] was restored{{Fn|1a}}. They even dared to use the [[Minotaurs]] [[Space Marines Chapter]], which arrived on [[Terra]] in its full might to bolster the Hexarchy.{{Fn|1d}} However their plot ended in failure, after it was revealed that Fadix's loyalty to the Hexarchy's cause had been a ruse from the start. He was the [[Grand Master of Assassins]] and after a signal was given, each of the Hexarchy's members were killed by Fadix's well placed assassins.  The Minotaurs had been used to bring the coup members into the open.{{Fn|1c}}

'''High Gothic''' (or &quot;Tech&quot;) is the hieratic tongue of the [[Imperium]], used in the titles of ancient institutions and organisations (such as the [[Adeptus Terra]]). It represents an older language and is regarded as holy. In the [[Age of the Imperium]], it is the Warhammer equivalent of Latin or French during the real-life medieval age.

High Gothic is also known as &quot;Tech&quot; as it is a version of the language in which technical rituals and ancient works are recorded. This developed during the [[Dark Age of Technology]]. It derives from the common tongue of the time, in the Merican/Pan-Pacific region. This was the universal medium of written record until the [[Age of Strife]], and was spoken as a first language by many and as a second language by almost everyone. Its idioms and vocabulary now appear archaic and mystic, and many of its words have acquired religious significance over the years. It is the language of the [[Tech-priest]]s and of forbidden books.

High Gothic is unintelligible to most Imperial citizens. It is only the language of important [[adept]]s and members of the [[Inquisition]], and even among those who can speak it, it is only a second language. It is used only formally (as in pious benedictions), rather than as a casual language.

[[Low Gothic]], a bastardised version of High Gothic, is the common tongue of the [[Imperium]].

[[Image:NecroHive.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A layout of a Hive on [[Necromunda]] ]]
A '''hive''' is a huge urban accretion, built-up over many thousands of years, and home to countless numbers of people.{{Fn|1}}

==Overview==
Around the entire [[Imperium]] over 85% of all planets have at least one hive city cluster.{{Fn|1}}

Hives consist of great housing and factory blocks, forming ranges of man-made mountains. These huge towering urban complexes are known as city hives, or simply as hives, and their individual peaks or towers are called city spires or spires. A close group of hives is known as a hive cluster. There are often several thousand hives on a single [[Hive world]]. A Hive consists of many layers; the lowest layers form the '''underhive'''. Hives are worlds in themselves, where the populace has never seen the outer world, and concepts such as the ground and sky are completely alien. There are entire regions inside the hive blocked off by collapsed sections, where is found the treasure of the hive, the [[Archeotech]] hoards, ancient stores of technology.{{Cite this}}

The upper hive is the region in which the administrators of the hive and various important people live. The homes are better, space is a premium and power is free for all. Life is easy here.The spires are the furthest from the horrors of the lower levels and as such are the best fitted. They are for anyone visiting the planet, giving the best view of the surroundings. Some hive spires pierce through the cloud barriers giving a huge area to watch over.

The [[Underhive]] is the most run-down area where most of the rules are created by [[gang]]s. It is a difficult place to live where the power has long been turned off. People rule through fear and shun the rich above them in the better apartments.{{Cite this}}

The outskirts are not as bad to live in as the underhive, but certainly not an easy place to live. Power is non existant and running water and constant food supplies are rare. It is certain that people die of starvation here or of some disease spreading through the area.{{Cite this}}

There are also orbital Hive cities exists, like for example on the [[Vesmir II]]. There the main big hives are connected with the gas-enshrouded planet via the elevator mineshafts providing a steady flow of raw materials.{{Fn|2}}

==Main Parts of any Hive City{{Fn|1}}==
The main Sectors of each Hive City are:
*'''Sectors Imperialis''' - the main hive levels (the most varied and populated of divisions within a hive city);
*'''Sectors Periferus''' - the outskirts beyond a hive's borders;
*'''Sectors Mechanicus''' - heavy industrial zones;
*'''Sectors Spirum''' - the upper spires;
*'''Sectors Habculum''' - vast hab-blocks;
*'''Sectors Infernus''' - either the underhive or the underwastes.

'''Hive Scum''', or ''' Scummers''', are masterless or itinerant [[Imperial]] [[Hive]]rs who will fight for anyone who offers them coin. Some are mercenaries who travel from zone to zone, earning whatever easy money is around before moving on. Many though are drunkards and down-and-outs who, despite their appearances, are more than capable of holding their own in a fight. Regardless of their background, Hive Scum are too wild and independent to submit to the leadership of anyone for very long and will only work when they feel like it â€” as their services are always in demand.{{Fn|1}}

In the [[Underhive]] of [[Necromunda (planet)|Necromunda]], most Hive Scum end up working for the [[Merchant Guild]]s, though a few are always willing to aid one the [[Hive World]]'s numerous gangs. They are especially valuable to newly created gangs, who hire Hive Scum to supplement their low numbers or inexperienced gang members. For the more established gangs, however, Hive Scum are either seen as not worth hiring or nothing more than cannon fodder to use against the gang's enemies.{{Fn|1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">The history of the [[Imperium]] is filled with heroic individuals whose noble deeds and sacrifice on the battlefield are the stuff of legends. Though the names of the vast majority are forgotten, occasionally a hero has become idolized by the Imperiumâ€™s populace. A few of these heroes have even been declared '''saints''', and '''great statues''' were raised in their honour. In the succeeding centuries, it was common for buildings to be built beside, or even around these '''statues''', towering architectures constructed by the [[Ecclesiarchy]] to awe the pilgrims flocking daily to pay homage.{{Fn|1}}

Millennia of war have reduced many of these edifices to ruins. Sometimes though, remnants of '''ancient statuary''' remain more or less intact amidst the devastation, their survival seen as a blessing from the [[Emperor]]. No citizen of the Imperium who looks upon these '''honoured monuments''' is not moved by their holy provenance, and soldiers fighting in the shadow of these '''memorials''' to the Emperorâ€™s greatest heroes are inspired to untold levels of courage as they endeavour to emulate their legendary deeds.{{Fn|1}}

'''House Farwell''' was an [[Imperial]] mercantile clan active on [[Armageddon]], based out of [[Hive Helsreach]].{{Fn|1}}

They are known to have possessed a private armed security force known as the [[House Farwellian Constabulary]]. This, however, did not save them in the [[Third War for Armageddon]]; when the [[ork]]s [[Helsreach Crusade|invaded]] Helsreach, the presence of several hundred armed Constabularies protecting the House's estates proved an irresistible lure for the greenskins. Seeking a good scrap, the orks overran the Farwellian estate and butchered the Imperials present to the last man.{{Fn|1}}

'''House Tarracine''' was an [[Imperial]] mercantile clan active on [[Armageddon]], based out of [[Hive Helsreach]].{{Fn|1}}

The House's estate was destroyed by the [[ork]]s when they [[Helsreach Crusade|invaded]] Helsreach during the [[Third War for Armageddon]]. However, thanks to an expertly-orchestrated defence, seven members of House Tarracine survived the attack; these scions of Tarracine, along with the House as a whole, were left in a strong position compared to the other mercantiles of Helsreach when the time came to rebuild the city following the invasion.{{Fn|1}}

'''Hub-Fortresses''' are a new type of planetary and orbital classification of the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

Introduced by [[Roboute Guilliman]] for the [[Indomitus Crusade]] via the [[Borachae Decree]], Hub-Fortresses are used as bases for the [[Officio Logisticarum]] to support the ever-expanding Crusade. Once a Crusade Fleet passed through an era, it would often establish Hub-Fortresses in their wake. Many Hub-Fortresses are converted [[Fortress World]]s. As Hub-Fortresses are established by Fleet Groupmasters of the Indomitus Crusade, they vary greatly in size and makeup depending upon local context and requirements.{{Fn|1}}

'''Hypno-Indoctrination''' is an [[Imperial]] psycho-encode process, that rapidly instills knowledge within a subject's psyche via the usage of modifiable memetic packages.{{Fn|1}}
==Description==
It usage originates in the pre-[[Unification]] [[Terran]] civilizations, which used Hypno-Indoctrination to create legions of vassals. The process would then be used by the [[Imperium]] and during the [[Great Crusade]] it found limited use within the [[Adeptus Administratum|Administration]], [[Remembrancer Order]] and the ranks of the [[Space Marine Legion]]s. Hypno-Indoctrination was first used by the Legions on their [[Aspirants]] as the [[Sol System]] was being conquered by the Imperium's forces. The process swiftly accepted by the Legions and it became a benign method to increase their recruitment process, though it still proved inferior to hands-on training. There were drawbacks, however, as it was recorded that veteran Legionaries lacked respect for their brethren who underwent the Hypno-Indoctrination. It was also found, however, that repeated usage of the process, caused Aspirants to develop stunted tactical acumen and combat readiness, when compared to other Legionaries.{{Fn|1}} 

The outbreak of the [[Horus Heresy]], saw the [[Loyalist Legion|Loyalist]] and [[Traitor Legion]]s disregard these drawbacks however. As they rapidly increased their ranks with newly created Legionaries known as [[Inductii]], Hypno-Indoctrination became favored to make up for the shortcuts and lack of training they received. In order to rapidly inject their minds with combat knowledge, the Inductii's memetic packages included weapons training, battle tactics and in many instances, subliminal obedience messages. The usage of Hypno-Inoctrination varied between the Legions, and even within their forces, as some chose not to make use of it. However after the [[Siege of Terra]] was ended, and the Traitors were defeated, it was discovered that those Inductii who had heavily used Hypno-Indoctrination, had become severely damaged by the process. Dissections of those slain on [[Terra]], showed that the Inductii bore minor to severe neural degradation, persona dissociation, scarring of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex â€“ resulting in decreased inhibition and increased aggression â€“ and loss of pre-enhancement memories. The Loyalist Legions that made heavy use of the process, were noted for using indoctrination programs, to fill their Inductii's cognitive gaps with traits the Legions found agreeable.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Illuminati''' are a secret society, existing beyond even the [[Emperor]]'s knowledge, but manipulating and interpreting the Imperial Will to bring about their objectives.

== Overview ==
Every member is a part of the society by virtue of being &quot;illuminated&quot; through the experience of [[daemonic possession]], and finally salvation. Possessed by a [[daemon]], they have done what seems impossible, exorcising the daemon from their body through their own sheer will.

In most cases, a [[daemonhost]] does not survive possession - the victim is eventually driven insane, or the mind is driven out of the host body so that the daemon takes complete control of it. A daemon can exist indefinitely within a host, with the possessed host often continuing their mortal life. Sometimes a strong-willed host can put up some resistance and preserve their self within a tenuous corner of the possessed brain. The host mind survives as a mere helpless witness as the daemon uses the mortal body to wreak its terrible acts. In a few instances, however, an individual has managed to cast the daemon from their body.

The Illuminati have been 'illuminated' to the terror of [[Chaos]]. Sharing a mind with a daemon, they have gained the most intimate understanding of Chaos. Having mastered the Chaos within themselves, they are immune to its temptations and corruption, and they now fight it in the broader universe. As they share a common enemy, the Illuminati are frequently involved on some level with the [[Eldar]], in particular the [[Harlequin]]s. The Illuminati are some of the very few allowed access to the Eldar's [[Black Library of Chaos]]. They know of the [[Fall of the Eldar]], and seek to prevent the same from happening to Man.

The Illuminatis' experiences have brought them to a level of harsh realism that has no equal. The Illuminati are devoted solely to mankind's preservation. Ultimately, this goal involves plotting to bring about the rebirth of the [[Emperor of Mankind]]. They realize the Emperor's mind is failing, His will fragmenting into warring parts, and that there will come a time where the Emperor has deteriorated to the point where His will finally breaks. Without the Emperor, mankind will fall to Chaos. The Illuminati plan to rejuvenate the Emperor by sacrificing His descendants, the [[Sensei]], at the moment the Emperor's will finally fails. The Emperor will be reborn, as the Sensei-Emperor, to again lead humanity directly. Their plans are a carefully kept secret; should the Emperor learn their plan, He may see no reason to continue to endure, and allow Himself to die prematurely. Should the Sensei learn, they may be unwilling to meet their intended fate.

The Illuminati influence events to pave the way for the Emperor's rebirth, and gather together the Sensei, protecting them from the persecution of the [[Inquisition]].

The [[Ordo Malleus]] of the Inquisition know of the Illuminati, considering them dangerous heretics. They fear the Illuminati's plans are influenced by Chaos. The Ordo Malleus are devoted to wiping out the Illuminati and Sensei whenever they come across them, while in this secret war, the Illuminati engage in a campaign of confusion and disinformation against the Ordo Malleus.

Many Illuminati are also Inquisitors, which gives the brotherhood much more power and influence.

Furthermore, within the Illuminati there is an even more extreme faction known as the [[Ordo Hydra]] that seeks to save mankind by linking the mind of every individual through a warp entity known as the Hydra, thereby psychically unifying mankind into one being under the control of the Ordo Hydra themselves.

== Notes ==
The Illuminati were introduced in the [[Realm of Chaos]] books alongside the Sensei and Star Child background material.

In 2013, for the release of the updated [[Apocalypse (2013)]] rules, a national campaign event based on the [[Realm of Chaos]] background was released in Italy (since June 29th 2013 until July 27th 2013).

In the appendix for the 2022 novel [[Throne of Light (Novel)|Throne of Light]], it is stated the Illuminati were a cult that was destroyed some years before the formation of the [[Great Rift]].{{Fn|4}}

The population of the [[Imperium]] is unimaginably vast.  The Imperium's roughly one million worlds are inhabited by [[human]]s or human-descended [[abhuman]]s.  Although they are all citizens of the Imperium, citizenship confers no rights, only responsibilities.

[[Adept]]s are servants of the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] and are legally above simple citizens, possessing at the very least, the legal benefits of housing and employment within the Imperium.  The difference between adept and common citizen is much more pronounced on [[Terra]].

[[Image:GovernorSymbol.png|thumb|right|120px|Symbol of Imperial Commanders{{Fn|6}}]]
[[Image:Governor.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Planetary Governor]]
An '''Imperial Commander''', often referred to as a '''Governor''', is a figure with (often hereditary){{Fn|9}} authority to rule a world in the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor's]] name.  They are the chief overseers of [[Imperial]] worlds, although some Imperial Commanders administer not mere planets, but [[Sector Lord|entire Sectors and Sub-Sectors]].{{Fn|4}}  They have been known to come not from just nobility, but also the [[Imperial Guard]], [[Space Marines]]{{Fn|5}} and [[Ecclesiarchy]]{{Fn|6}}.

==Overview==
Naturally, since the vast and dispersed nature of Imperial territory would make a totally centralized system of government unfeasible, the Planetary Governor is given discretionary control over the administration (including governance, defence and development) of the planet in question.  In theory he (or she) is duty-bound to the [[Adeptus Terra]].  Essentially though, he is an independent governor. As long as the planet's [[tithes]], [[mutant]] and [[psyker]] &quot;head counts&quot; are kept under control and the planet is governed competently, he is free to run the planet however he chooses.{{Cite this}}

They are expected to defend the planet in the name of Imperium, maintaining [[Planetary Defense Forces]] and orbital defences. Due to the fickle nature of the warp, communication with the [[Adeptus Terra]] is often delayed and sometimes prevented entirely.  Often this means that Governors must make decisions on the defence of their world without advice and help from [[Terra]], meaning that for the world to prosper, every Governor must be adept at military matters as well as the development of the planet's trade infrastructure.{{Cite this}}

Even though Governors are given these powers over a planet, they come at a price. The governor is a sworn vassal of the Imperium, and as such is required to provide military support to local campaigns.  In the early period of the Imperium this was a simple process, a straightforward pledge to provide a certain number of troops and to fight in person.  This was seen to be too inflexible because as the Imperium grew, the differing numbers of troops provided made poor use of some planets' populations and on others too high a proportion of the population was sent to war, leaving the planet sorely short of labour.  This was later replaced with a [[tithe]]. It is assessed by the wealth and available resources of the planet.{{Cite this}}

As part of the tithe, the governor is expected to supply troops to the [[Imperial Guard]], the troops often being requisitioned from the planet's existing defense forces.  The tithe is also a percentage of the planet's produce.  Most tithes are regular obligations, while others are demanded when specific circumstances are met.{{Cite this}}

This leads to a close relationship between Planetary Governors and the [[Departmento Munitorum]] who look after the deployment of men and supplies across the galaxy.  Both tithes go to the Munitorum, which can raise soldiers from across entire sectors.{{Cite this}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6386">The [[Imperium]] has two distinct dating systems.

==Old Style (Pre-Great Rift)==
__NOTOC__The [[Imperium]] had developed its own method of recording dates, which needs a bit of explanation. Most importantly, the years are based on the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; system, so the dates themselves are the ones that we are familiar with now. A typical date as Imperial scholars write it would look something like '''0123456.M41'''. Let's divide this code up to explain each part:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em; background:#4F4F4F;text-align:center;&quot;
 |-style=&quot;background:#707070;&quot;
 |0
 |123
 |456
 |M41
 |-style=&quot;background:#707070;&quot;
 !Check
 !Year Fraction
 !Year
 !Millennium
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;check&quot;&gt;
===Check Number===
The check number refers to the accuracy in the date as compared to time on Terra, with 0 being the most accurate and 9 being the least. Class 0 refers to events that occurred on [[Terra]], with each increasing number being a further degree of separation from [[Terra]].

====Location Based====
A 0 means that the event occurred on Terra.

A 1 means that the event occurred within the Sol system.

====Contact Based====
A 2 means that the event occurred while someone present for the event was in direct psychic contact with Terra or the Sol system.

A 3 means that an individual or organization present was in psychic contact with a 2 source while the event occurred.

A 4 means that the individual or organization was in contact with a 3 OR 2 source.

A 5 means that the individual or organization was in contact with a 4 source.

A 6 means that the individual or organization was in contact with a 5 source.

====Estimation Based====
A 7 means that the event in question occurred within 10 years of the date listed in the rest of the Imperial date.

An 8 means that the event occurred within 20 years of the date.

A 9 class source is special. A 9-class source is an approximated date, and is usually used when recording a date within Warp travel or while on a planet that does not use the Imperial system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;yearfrac&quot;&gt;

===Year Fraction===
For record-keeping, each year is divided into 1000 equal parts, numbered 000-999. Note that this is not generally used by Imperial citizens, but is simply for administrative use. Each increment of the year fraction corresponds to approximately eight hours and forty-five minutes Terran standard. &lt;!-- 1 year = 8,742 hours --&gt;

====How to determine the Year Fraction on Terra====
Rather than dividing the year into approximately 365 days like we do, the Imperium divides the year into 1000 fractions. So, &quot;549&quot; indicates the 549th part of 1000 parts of the year.

To calculate this, first you need to find on which day of the year your event occurred. Using July 18th of 2005 as an example, you then determine the Julian date, which is the 200th day of 2005. Next we need to split it into hours. We do that by multiplying 200 by 24 then add the hour of the day the event occurred. If the event took place at 4pm (the 16th hour) the formula to find the Determined Hour would be: 
&lt;br&gt; 200 x 24 + 16 = 4816 Determined Hour

To convert that to an Imperial Fraction, multiply your Determined Hour above by the Makr Constant: 0.11407955.
&lt;br&gt; 4816 x 0.11407955 = 549.41. Always round this number down to determine the closest Year Fraction that occurred before the event. So the Year Fraction would be 549.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;year&quot;&gt;

===Year===
This is the year within the millennium, running from 000-999. For general dates, often only the year and Millennium (below) are included. If the Terran calendar year was 2005 then the Imperial Dating System Year would be 005.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;mill&quot;&gt;

===Millennium===
This is the millennium in which the event occurred. Most &quot;recent&quot; events in the Warhammer 40K universe occur in [[M41]], or the 41st millennium. If an event was in 2005 it would have occurred in [[M3]] or M03, the 3rd millennium.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

==New Style (Post-Great Rift)==
After the formation of the [[Great Rift]] in the ending stages of the [[41st Millennium]], the flow of time no longer became standard across the [[galaxy]]. As a result, [[Roboute Guilliman]] attempted to amend the dating system and create a reliable Imperial history to fit the new situation. The result has been met with controversy and a civil war known as the [[Chronostrife]] has broken out within the [[Inquisition]]'s [[Ordo Chronos]].{{Fn|2}}

The new Imperial dating system takes into account the local flow of time, which usually does not match the standard elsewhere.{{Fn|3}}

===Vigilus Template===
The method of the new system seen below uses the world of [[Vigilus]] as a case study.{{Fn|3}}

The first element of Vigilus' timestamp is the annual designator. It starts with the number of years either before or after the rift opened, and then a number of chronosegments within that year as the second element. Imperial days are broken down into choronosegments of eight hours. After this is a third element - either 'previo' if the events occurred before the opening of the Great Rift, or 'post' if after it. This third element is sometimes denoted as a minus sign or plus sign.

The fourth element of the Vigilus timestamp is the system's designator initials; in essence, the initials of the system to which it refers. For Vigilus, this is VCM which stands for &quot;Vigilus [[Cicatrix Maledictum]]&quot;. For its neighboring planet, [[Omis-Prion]], the designator initials would be OPCM.

By way of a full example, if the time of an event in the [[Vigilus System]] was three days (nine chronosegments) before the opening of the [[Great Rift]], the timestamp would be '0.9 previo VCM.M41', also expressed as '0.9 previo' or '0.9-'.

This translates as '0 years and 9 chronosegments (three days) previous to the Vigilus System's first instance of the Cicatrix Maledictum in the 41st Millennium.'

If it was one year and eight hours after, the timestamp would be '1.1 post VCM.M41', also expressed as '1.1 post' or '1.1+'.

'''Imperial Regent''', sometimes called '''Lord Regent''' or the '''Regent of [[Terra]]''' is a title in the [[Imperium]] used several times throughout history.

Extremely prestigious, it is second only to the [[Emperor]] in authority. Its holder is said to be the living voice of the Emperor.{{Fn|3}} The title sometimes overlaps with [[Lord Commander of the Imperium]], but presumably includes civic authority as well as military. The title was one of the few positions that warranted the placement of members of the [[Adeptus Custodes]] as bodyguards. The post was presumably created after the Emperor of Mankind withdrew from the [[Great Crusade]], and the administration of Terra in general, to work on his own [[Webway Project|secret projects]].{{Fn|5}}

===Known Imperial Regents===
*[[Malcador the Sigillite]] â€” The first Imperial Regent. Held the post during the [[Great Crusade]] and [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1}}
*[[Sanguinius]] â€” ''Emperor Regent'' of [[Imperium Secundus]] during the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|2}}
*[[Roboute Guilliman]] â€” Regent in the aftermath of the [[Horus Heresy]]. 10,000 years later Guilliman took on the title again following his [[Ultramar Campaign|resurrection]].{{Fn|3}}
*[[Maximus Thane]] â€” Regent in the years following [[The Beheading]] and the [[War of the Beast]].{{Fn|4}}
*[[Dante]] â€” Lord Regent of [[Imperium Nihilus]] following the [[Devastation of Baal]].{{Fn|6}}

{{otheruses|USE=Imperial term|OTHERUSE=Short Story by Ben Counter|OTHERPAGE=The Tithe (Short Story)}}
The '''Imperial Tithe''', also named the '''Grand Harvesting''', '''Great Tithe'''{{Fn|6}}, or '''Terra's Due'''{{Fn|2}}, refers to the amount of materials an Imperial world must supply to the [[Administratum]]. 

==Overview==
Two types of Tithe's are demanded of Imperial worlds. The first is a military tithe which translates into 1/10th of a planet's [[PDF]] being gathered as new recruits for the [[Imperial Guard]].{{Fn|4}} The second, known as '''Exacta''', includes all other types of resources or wealth. Collection of the first type of Tithe is overseen by the [[Departmento Munitorum]] while collection of the second is overseen by the [[Departmento Exacta]]. Tithe's are physically collected by Administratum authorities which periodically arrive on the subject world. The frequency of visits varies world to world, but in at least one case the Departmento Munitorum visited a planet nine times in a year, demanding new Imperial Guard conscripts each time.{{Fn|5}}

The size of the tithe depends on the type of world to which it is applied. A tithe can be any form of material: food, weapons, minerals, people, etc. Despite the number of agencies tracking tithes, the sheer size of the Imperium and the difficulty of [[Warp]] travel makes the time-consuming process of tithe collection excessively confusing and inefficient.{{Fn|2}} 

It is the duty of [[Planetary Governor]]s to ensure the tithe of their world is paid, and any world that fails to pay its tithe meets with vicious reprisal from the [[Adeptus Terra]]. At the slightest breach of protocol, Imperial officials will often order the [[Adeptus Arbites]] to immediately execute the Governor. However, as long as the planetary ruler dutifully pays his world's tithe, he may rule the planet in almost any way he sees fit.{{Fn|2}}

==Tithe Exemptions==
[[Space Marines|Space Marine]] [[Adeptus Astartes Homeworld|homeworlds]], planets belonging to the [[Ecclesiarchy]]{{Fn|6}}, and [[Forge World]]s of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] do not normally have tithes, and are given the tithe grade [[Aptus Non]], though Space Marines must provide a separate tithe in [[Gene-Seed]] to the Administratum.{{Fn|2a}} Certain worlds which supply large amounts of [[Psyker]]s to the [[League of Black Ships|Black Ships]] of the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]] are also known to be exempt from the standard tithe.{{Fn|2b}}

However even worlds exempt from the Imperial Tithe are not always exempt from scrutiny or collections. The [[Sisters of Silence]] are known to gather [[Blank]]s from worlds normally immune from the demands of the Tithe.{{Fn|6}}

==Tithe Grades{{Fn|1}}==
*Orbis Cassi - Used after a world is of no further use to the Imperium{{Fn|7}}
*[[Aptus Non]] (also Adeptus Non) - Lowest{{Fn|1}}
*Solutio Tertius
*Solutio Prima
*Solutio Extremis
*Decuma Particular

{{Otheruses
|USE=doctrine
|OTHERUSE=anthology
|OTHERPAGE=The Imperial Truth (Anthology)
}}
The '''Imperial Truth''' was a doctrine preached by the [[Imperium of Man]] during the years of the [[Great Crusade]].

==Overview==
The contents of this belief involved the removal of religion, faith and superstition that plagued numerous [[Human]] worlds that had been recontacted by [[Terra]]. Instead, the Imperial Truth was offered by [[Iterator]]s that provided the cold clarity of logic and science to the masses.{{Fn|1}} Other key aspects of the Imperial Truth was the manifest destiny of mankind to rule the stars, the exceptionalism of [[humanity]], and the danger posed by all [[xenos]].{{Fn|4}} As part of his campaign to spread the Imperial truth, the Emperor's [[Thunder Warriors]] destroyed all churches on [[Terra]], believing it to be necessary to have humanity accept science and reason over superstition and barbarism.{{Fn|3}} In truth, the Emperor sought to wipe out superstition and religion as they were easy doors from which the powers of [[Chaos]] entered the minds of men.{{Fn|5}}

The Imperial Truth began to disintegrate due to the [[Horus Heresy]] and encounters with the [[Chaos|Dark Powers]] of the [[Warp]]. Many either turned Traitor as a result or embraced the growing [[Lectitio Divinitatus]] which proclaimed that the [[Emperor]] was a god.{{Fn|2}}

'''Imperium Eterna''' is the name given by [[Terran]] [[Imperial]]s to the previous state of the [[Imperium]], before it was heavily changed by [[Lord Commander]] [[Guilliman]].{{Fn|1a}} 

Those who do so, yearn to undo [[Guilliman]]'s work, as they consider ''Imperium Eterna'' to be a perfect realm whose [[Lex Imperialis]] reflected the [[Emperor]]'s will. They claim the damning changes wrought by Guilliman, ruined the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]]'s design and protest that the [[Lord Commander]]'s [[Indomitus Crusade]] continues to bleed [[Terra]] of its resources and defenders. More strikingly some feel that the Lord Commander has ignored the [[Great Rift|violent strife that still rivets]] Terra, as he is instead more concerned with thousands of other worlds. Guilliman's most damning [[Irthu Haemotalion|critics]] state that restoring ''Imperium Eterna'' would have the [[Imperium of Mankind|Imperium]] ruled once more by [[High Lords|mortals]] and not uncaring [[Primarch]]s who are far removed from Terra's turmoil.{{Fn|1b}}

|align=center|'''''You gaze at the mountain, Children of Terra, you see its snow-capped peak and the clouds upon its slopes. You dream of reaching that pinnacle and drinking the cold waters. But who dreams of the road that ascends the mountain side? The road to the peak is hard and murderous. It has broken countless Children of Terra upon its rocks. Their splintered bones lie scattered upon it, paving the way to the mountain top. At every step you will hear the bones crumbling under foot, and maybe you shall hear the wind-blown voices of the dead - guiding you forward or leading you to your doom. Yes, my children, the way to the mountain is cruel and unforgiving. And of those who struggle their long lives, spending their energy and vigour in the climb, who then can taste the melt-water of the summit and say, 'Yes... yes it was worthwhile?''''''

The '''Imperium Sanctus''' is one of the two halves of the [[Imperium]] since the formation of the [[Great Rift]], the other being [[Imperium Nihilus]]. 

==Overview==
The half of Humanity's domain known as Imperium Sanctus has fared better in the wake of the Great Rift's opening, though this is only speaking compratively. Consisting of [[Segmentum]]s [[Solar]], [[Pacificus]], [[Tempestus]], and parts of [[Ultima]] and [[Obscurus]], it is within the light of the [[Astronomican]]. The strategic situation within Imperium Sanctus is more stable and the forces of the Imperium enforce the [[Emperor]]'s rule throughout it. Despite this, it still suffers from dangerous [[Warp]] travel and the inefficient bureaucracy characteristic of the Imperium at large. For all its nihilistic misery and soulless oppression, the Imperium Sanctus continues to grind onwards and sends out to reclaim lost worlds and territory on the other side of the Great Rift.{{Fn|3a}}

The seat of Imperium Sanctus is [[Terra]], capital of Humanity.{{Fn|3a}}

The '''Index Bearers''' are a group of [[Imperial]]s, who carry the massive copy of [[Lord Commander]] [[Guilliman]]'s [[Index Astartes]], during ceremonies.{{Fn|1}}
==History==
They accompany the [[Recorder of the Rolls]] during such times, as the Recorder is charged with writing down the [[Lord Commander]]'s words. Besides the [[Index Astartes]] itself, the Bearers also carry a large stand to hold it, as well as a small table to put the Recorder's needed bottles of ink and numerous pens on. The Recorder will then cast a critical eye over everything's placement and if it meets with their approval, the Bearers will reverently open the Index to a blank page. When all is ready, the Recorder will signal to Lord Commander [[Guilliman]] that they are ready, to record his words. Once the ceremony is over, the Index Bearers will carry the Index and everything else away, until it is needed again. The Recorder of the Rolls and the Index Bearers also conducted their duties, over the course of the [[Indomitus Crusade]] and were stationed within Guilliman's [[Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus]].{{Fn|1}}

The '''Inspectorate of Shipping'''{{Fn|1a}} is an [[Imperial]] organization charged with investigating the [[Merchant Fleets]] whenever major irregularities in scheduling or shipping occur{{Fn|1b}}. Field agents known as '''Inspectors''' are sent in person to investigate these occurrences, and wear a coat as a standard uniform{{Fn|1c}} and are issued a [[laspistol]] with which to defend themselves{{Fn|1d}}. These agents have the power to go wherever their investigation takes them and even offer Inspectorate confidentiality agreements, within limits, in order to solve their cases{{Fn|1a}}. In practice, however, there are certain areas of the [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]]' [[Nexus Axiomaticâ€Ž]] fortress that are deemed to be off-limits to outsiders. Any Inspector who attempts to enter them will be met by the armed [[Praeses Mercatura]] and told the Inspectorate of Shipping has no jurisdiction in those areas.{{Fn|1b}}

Imperial '''Iterators''' were public speakers, and masters of manipulating crowds and altering public opinion. The [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] appointed them to spread the [[Imperial Truth]] among his people, for example the rejection of the religions and petty squabbling which had brought about the [[Age of Strife]].{{Fn|1}}

They were most prevalent among the fleets of the [[Great Crusade]], where they would not only lecture and rally the Imperial troops and [[Astartes]] legions, but also educate the vanquished human civilisations on the values and virtues of the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

[[Warmaster]] [[Horus]] admired the Iterators' work, so much that he asked them to also tutor his Captains and Legionaries; Horus believed that, once the Crusade was completed, there would be an end to war and the [[Astartes]] would need to find a peacetime vocation.{{Fn|1}}

The most famous iterator of the [[Great Crusade]] was Primary Iterator [[Kyril Sindermann]], who served aboard Horus's flagship, the ''[[Vengeful Spirit]]'' at the head of the [[63rd Expeditionary Fleet]].{{Fn|1}}

The '''Jau Clan''' is the most ruthless of the [[Imperial]] world [[Asterion]]'s '''Founding Families'''{{Fn|1b}} [[Noble House]]s. It also secretly operates as one of the most dangerous of the [[Macharian Sector]]'s [[Criminal Cartel]]s.{{Fn|1a}}
==Description==
They control a massive illicit empire, that touches many worlds, across the [[Macharian Sector]]{{Fn|1a}}. However the Jau Clan make use of proxies to keep their many [[Criminal Cartel|criminal]] activates, from being tracked back to their gilded halls on [[Asterion]]. Anyone who does discover the their illicit secrets, will usually meet their end at the hands of the Cartel's vat-grown assassins{{Fn|1b}}. All this had led the Jau Clan to develop a reputation that they are not to be crossed, lest you want to court death.{{Fn|1a}}

The '''Lakonia Persecution''' was the name given to the [[Imperium|Imperial]] mission to track, capture and contain the [[Renegade Space Marine]]s of the [[Soul Drinkers]] [[Chapter]].{{Fn|1e}}

==Overview==
At one point in [[M41]], a Soul Drinkers taskforce led by [[Space Marine Commander|Commander]] [[Caeon]] took part in an [[Administratum]]-orchestrated raid on the [[Van Skorvold Star Fort]] in the [[Lakonia System]].  Although the official reason for the raid was to sanction the [[Van Skorvold Cartel]], the members of which were suspected of a number of crimes against the Imperium, the Soul Drinkers were acting on intelligence that the Van Skorvolds had come into possession of a lost relic of the Chapter - a legendary weapon known as the [[Soulspear]].{{Fn|1a}}{{Fn|1b}}

In the assault on the star fort, Caeon was killed by [[Veritas Van Skorvold]] and was succeeded as Commander of the strike force by [[Librarian]] [[Sarpedon]].  Despite this, the Soul Drinkers were able to locate the Soulspear in the cartel's vaults.  As they moved to secure it, however, the weapon was stolen by the Chapter's [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] allies operating under the orders of [[Magos|Archmagos]] [[Khobotov]].{{Fn|1b}}  The Soul Drinkers threatened retribution against the Imperial [[battlefleet]] supporting them in an effort to get the Mechanicus to relinquish the Soulspear, but Khobotov then deployed a [[Geryon Ordinatus]] platform from his ship capable of destroying the star fort if the [[Space Marines]] did not stand down.{{Fn|1c}}  The Soul Drinkers instead launched an assault on the Geryon, destroying it and crippling the battlefleet.{{Fn|1d}}

Sarpedon discovered, however, that the Soulspear had already been transported away from the fleet, taken by Khobotov to his forge on [[Koden Tertius]].{{Fn|1c}}  The Soul Drinkers then fled the [[system]] aboard their [[Strike Cruisers]] ''[[Gundog]]'' and ''[[Unendingly Just]]'', destroying the Van Skorvold Star Fort as they left.{{Fn|1d}}  The remaining functional ships of the battlefleet then pursued the Space Marines, who were forced to take refuge in an asteroid belt called the [[Cerberian Field]].{{Fn|1e}}

Now known as the Lakonia Persecution, the Imperial battlefleet and the renegade Marines were locked in a stalemate lasting months, with the Imperial ships unwilling to enter the Field due to the danger posed by the asteroids.{{Fn|1e}}  Eventually, the [[Inquisition]] intervened, with [[Inquisitor Lord|Lord]] [[Gorgo Tsouras]] of the [[Ordo Hereticus]] taking command of the fleet.  He sent one of his [[Acolyte|agents]], the [[Interrogator]] [[K'Shuk]], to parlay with the Marines, offering them one final chance to stand down and surrender to the Inquisition.  When the Soul Drinkers refused, Tsouras formally declared the entire Chapter [[Excommunicate Traitoris]] and ordered the battlefleet into the Field regardless to destroy them.  However, the remainder of the Soul Drinkers Chapter suddenly arrived in system and extracted Sarpedon's force before escaping.{{Fn|1f}}

In the wake of the operation's failure, Tsouras led a purge of the surviving Imperial staff involved, condemning most of them to death.{{Fn|2}}

The '''Librarium Terra''' is a structure on [[Terra]] itself that serves as a respository of knowledge for the collected information of the [[Imperium]] of [[Human|Man]]. Situated deep within the crust of the planet itself and contained a labyrinth of corridors where towering rows of bookcases and datastacks are located. Within the Librarium, billions of souls worked through the bureaucracy that kept the Imperium together. Amongst its contents included particularly pure as well as dangerous history{{Fn|1a}} along with details of the Imperium's armed forces, [[Imperial Guard]] regiments, and various military campaigns.{{Fn|1b}}

'''Life-Sellers''' were [[Horus Heresy]]-era [[Imperials]] on [[Terra]], who sold their lives dearly defending the [[Siege of Terra|besieged]] [[Imperial Palace]], after being unable or unwilling to enter the [[Eternity Gate]] before it closed.{{Fn|1d}}
==History==
Those that remained outside the last bastion of the [[Imperium]]'s territory, had no hope of receiving reinforcements and were left to fight on against the overwhelming hordes of [[Horus]]' forces. Among them was the [[Blood Angel]] [[Khotus Meffiel]], who first spoke of the term Life-Seller to the [[White Scar]] [[Zhintas Khan]]. In his mind, their deaths were now inevitable and the Imperials fighting outside of the [[Eternity Gate]] had one goal left to them: To sell their lives dearly and see how many Traitors they could kill, before death claimed them.{{Fn|1d}}

The '''Logos Historica Verita''' is a new governmental department of [[Roboute Guilliman]]'s reformed [[Imperium]]. Roboute Guilliman awoke in late [[M41]] to find that the Imperium's 10,000 year history was catalogued in an extremely unreliable, secretive, and often contradictory fashion. He created the Logos as a means to rectify this problem and create the first true reliable history of the Imperium.{{Fn|1}}

The Logos is made up of hundreds of skilled scholars and historians, hand-picked by Guilliman, and chosen for their more liberal views of historiography. The Logos' objectives and policies stand in stark contrast to the [[Ordo Chronos]], which has turned to [[Chronostrife|violence]] in response to Guilliman's reformations.{{Fn|1}}

As of [[M42]], the Logos is estimated to operate around 500 men and women.{{Fn|1}}

'''Lord Commander''' is a rank which occurs several times, past and present, in the upper echelons of the [[Imperium]].
==Imperial Navy==
Occasionally referenced as Lord Militant Commander and also referred to as [[Lord High Admiral]]{{Fn|11}}, a '''Lord Commander of the [[Imperial Navy]]''' has jurisdiction over the Imperial Navy in a [[Segmentum]] of the Imperium.{{Fn|7}} Of these, the Lord Commander of the Segmentum Solar is the foremost, and is often appointed to a position on the [[High Lords of Terra]].{{Fn|7}}{{Fn|9}}

===Notable Lord Commanders of the Imperial Navy===
*[[Jaxon]] ([[Segmentum Solar]]}
*[[Drang]] ([[Segmentum Obscurus]]){{cite this}}
*[[Invisticone]] ([[Segmentum Pacificus]]){{cite this}}
*[[Hal Orpheus]] ([[Segmentum Tempestus]])

==Imperial Guard==
{{IGHierarchy}}
A strategic rank of the [[Imperial Guard]] subordinate only to the [[Lord Commander Militant]], the five '''Lord Commanders of the Imperial Guard''' are each responsible for the Guard forces in each of the Imperium's [[segmentum]]s.{{Fn|10}}

===Notable Lord Commanders of the Imperial Guard===
*[[Macharius (Character)|Macharius]], [[Lord Commander Solar]]
*[[Arcadian Leontus]], [[Lord Commander Solar]]
*[[Phillips]], [[Lord Commander Solar]]
*[[Lucellin Tyberius]]
*[[Morcar]] - fought with the [[Eldar]]. See also [[Quotes Astra Militarum#M|His Quote]]{{Fn|15}}
*[[Otto Ivan Gustavus]]
*[[Von Klimt]]
*[[Sebiascor Ebongrave]]
*[[Ustrin]] - led a [[Victorium Crusade]]{{Fn|20}}
*[[Xaâ€™chan]], '''Lord High General'''{{Fn|13}}
*[[Zuehlke]]

==Imperial Army==
During the [[Great Crusade]], a '''Lord Commander of the Expedition Fleet''' was a position in the [[Imperial Army]], the highest of its kind. A Lord Commander was in charge of an entire [[Expedition Fleet]], unless a Primarch was attached to it; in which case the Primarch took precedence and the Lord Commander was chiefly in charge of the soldiers of the Imperial Army.{{Fn|3}}{{Fn|5}}

===Notable Lord Commanders of the Imperial Army===
* [[Hektor Varvarus]] (63rd Expedition Fleet)
* [[Thaddeus Fayle]] ([[28th Expedition Fleet]])
* [[Teng Namatjira]] (680th Expedition Fleet)

==Astartes==
''Main Articles: [[Legion Master]], [[Praetor (Rank)]]

'''Lord Commander''' was a title often used by [[Legion Master]]s in the Legiones Astartes{{fn|12}}, as well as being of the titles given to the members of the [[Astartes]] in charge of a [[Chapter]] formation during the [[Great Crusade]].{{Fn|1}} It was notably used by the [[Praetor (Rank)|Praetor]]s of the [[Emperor's Children]].{{fn|17}}

In [[M41]], at least one Space Marine Chapter, the [[Silver Skulls]], styles its [[Chapter Master]] as '''Lord Commander'''.  The current holder of the title is [[Argentius]].{{Fn|19}}

===Emperor's Children===
In the [[Emperor's Children]], for example, each of the Company Captains within the legion was assigned and reported directly to a specific Lord Commander. The Emperor's Children were taught to lead by example, and it was expected of Astartes to emulate their superior officers in the quest to become the perfect warriors. In this way the Company Captains reflected the beliefs of their Lord Commanders, and in turn passed these traits to the Sergeants and Initiates under them. {{Fn|2}}

During the [[Great Crusade]], the Emperor's Children were lead by several Lord Commanders, most notably [[Eidolon]] and [[Vespasian]]. Command of the III Legion's thirty companies was divided amongst them. As the [[Horus|Warmaster]] planned the legions' betrayal at [[Isstvan III|Isstvan]], Fulgrim realized that the companies under Vespasian's command were likely to remain loyal to the [[Emperor]]. He personally murdered Vespasian and sent the Lord Commander's men, including Captains [[Solomon Demeter|Demeter]] and [[Lucius the Eternal|Lucius]], to their doom on the the planet's surface. Vespasian's followers were beseiged by their corrupted brethren on the wasted remains of Isstvan III. Lucius, however, betrayed his friends [[Saul Tarvitz]] and Captain Demeter to the rebels, and all the marines that remained loyal to the Emperor were eventually killed. This treachery earned Lucius the title Lord Commander. {{Fn|4}}

* [[Cyrius]]
* [[Eidolon (Emperor's Children)|Eidolon]]
* [[Lucius (Emperor's Children)|Lucius]]
* [[Vespasian]]

==Lord Commander of the Imperium==
Lord Commander of the Imperium is the highest known military rank within the Imperial hierarchy, second only to the Emperor himself.{{Fn|14}} The first known holder was the [[Primarch]] [[Rogal Dorn]], who had the title during much of the [[Horus Heresy]] but later ceded it to [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|21}} After the Heresy Guilliman took command of the entirety of the Imperial armed forces and took the title of Lord Commander in order to stabilize the Imperium and begin the reforms for which he is famous. He was the only person in the history of the Imperium to control all of the Imperial armed forces (before this, the Imperial war machine was administered by the [[War Council]]). The Lord Commander of the Imperium was one of the High Lords of Terra during its use. {{Fn|6}}

Even after Guilliman's wounding at the hands of [[Fulgrim]], the title of Lord of Commander of the Imperium was still used and its holder served as both chairman of the High Lords and commander-in-chief of the Imperium's disparate military forces. In honor of the Primarch, the Lord Commander was often simply referred to as &quot;Lord Guilliman&quot;. The title is no longer used as of [[M41]], but continued at least until mid-[[M32]]. Known holders of the title during this time include [[Udin Macht Udo]]{{Fn|14}} and [[Chapter Master]]s [[Koorland]] and [[Maximus Thane]]. In the aftermath of the [[War of the Beast]] and [[The Beheading]], the position of Lord Commander of the Imperium was abolished.{{Fn|16}}

Later at the end of the 41st Millennium, the reborn [[Roboute Guilliman]] returned to Terra and declared himself Lord Commander once more.{{Fn|18}}

==Adeptus Mechanicus==
===Knights of Taranis===
The [[Knights of Taranis]], a [[Knight House]] on [[Mars]], was ruled by joint commanders each known as a '''Lord Commander''' of the Knights of Taranis.{{Fn|8}}

'''Low Gothic''' (or '''Imperial Gothic''') is the common language of the [[Imperium of Man]]. In the [[Age of the Imperium]] it is spoken as a first language on almost all [[Civilised World|civilised planets]], and is accepted as a second language on planets within Imperial control with the exception of some [[Feudal World|medieval]] and [[Feral World|feral worlds]].

Low Gothic is a bastardised version of [[High Gothic]], combining additional elements from several of the oriental languages of ancient [[Terra]]. Over the millennia it has changed greatly, and now bears almost no resemblance to the tongues from which it derived. Although a common language, it varies from planet to planet (and even from region to region), so that it is not always easy for two characters to communicate if they are from different worlds.

Medieval, feral and worlds suffering from long periods of isolation may have several indigenous languages derived either from High Gothic or one of the ancient Earth tongues. It was quite common during the [[Dark Age of Technology]] for worlds to be settled by small communities of &quot;isolationists&quot;. These eccentric groups were often self-financed and their journeys unrecorded, many were of racial minorities attempting to recreate a sense of national identity away from the overpopulated Earth. Some of these groups made a deliberate attempt to revive long dead or moribund languages, perceiving them as a source of national identity and communal strength.

*[[Vakrah Jal]] â€” &quot;Chapter of Consecrated Iron&quot;.

===[[Fenris]]ian===

The '''Macharian Vigilites''' are the most common [[Enforcer Security Force]] encountered on the worlds of the [[Macharian Sector]].{{Fn|1}}
==History==
Their origins date back to the [[Macharian Crusade]], where the Vigilites were either formed from [[Astra Militarum]] forces garrisoned on worlds that resisted the Crusade or from existing police forces whose worlds chose not to. Like all [[Enforcer (Security Force)|Enforcers]], they answer to their [[Planetary Governor]] and Vigilites typically sport heavy armor and high quality weapons. The equipment is designed to serve as an open threat against would-be lawbreakers, their Governor's foes and common citizenry alike, with the Vigilites brutally administering their version of justice when need be. Corruption runs rife amongst their ranks, however, and members of the Vigilites will often be willing to turn a blind eye for a price.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Magisters Calculo Horarium''' are select members of the [[Merchant Fleets]] chosen to guide its ships and interpret the passage of their trade across the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

They dwell deep within the [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]]' [[Nexus Axiomaticâ€Ž]] fortress on [[Terra]], though they have only been seen by a few people. This has led to numerous speculation about them, such as the Magisters being vile [[mutants]] and the Nexus was really constructed to keep from being discovered by the [[Inquisition]]. Others claim they are in fact immortals, born in the earliest years of [[mankind]]'s evolution and only kept alive through the regular transfusion of blood from younger bodies. Most believe though, that the Magisters are simply ciphers, whose role has long ago been taken over by magna-[[cogitator]]s.{{Fn|1a}}

However, [[Inquisitor Lord]] [[Erasmus Crowl]] would encounter a Magister during his attempt to uncover the masterminds that transported a [[Dark Eldar]] [[Haemonculus]] to Terra. Known as '''Magister Calculo Horarium IX''', they were in fact giant conjoined male twins whose faces were on a large skull that had an extended cranium. They shared one body, which contained numerous atrophied limbs, which Crowl noted gave them the appearance of a human jellyfish. The twins were so large and malformed that they were forced to live in a container filled with nutrient-rich liquid, which they breathed through with mechanical gills. They were also hooked up to numerous life-support systems and could communicate through nearby vid-screens that displayed their thoughts. Their personalities differed greatly, though, as the twin on the upper part of the skull received a never-ending flood of messages from the ships of the [[Merchant Fleets]]. He would then calculate and note the ships' locations and the paths they took to get to the worlds the ships delivered their cargo to. This consumed the twin's entire being and he never slept or stopped doing his unceasing task. This left him hard to communicate to, but that was the lower twin's nominal task. Unlike its brother, this twin was very lucid and very intelligent, which allowed it to easily engage with those who talked to him. It should be noted though, that it is not known if the other Magisters were similar in appearance to IX, nor if they functioned in the same way as the twins did.{{Fn|1b}}

The '''Magisterium Lex Ultima''' is an [[Imperial]] law, that renders no one within the Imperium but the [[Emperor]] Himself, capable of giving the [[Adeptus Custodes]] an order.{{Fn|1a}}
==Description==
They have always benefited from this and even [[Lord Commander]] [[Guilliman]] can only request the [[Custodes]]' aid. The Ultima also allows them to draw upon any facet of the [[Imperium]]'s military to aid them in their duties. It is what the Custodes use to take command of ships they require to traverse the stars, or serve any other purpose they deem necessary. Some of these commandeered ships, have been used on so many occasions, that they have effectively become permanently attached to the Adeptus Custodes.{{Fn|1a}}
  
The [[Custodes]]' [[Misericordia]]s, are also meant to be a physical symbol of the Magisterium Lex Ultima to the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1b}}

The '''Many With Eyes''' is an [[Imperial]] group, that were the attendees of the [[Rumour Engine]] [[cogitator]].{{Fn|1}}

==History==
It created small images that were glimpses into the future, but the sheer amount of inscrutable future-derived data the [[cogitator]] repetitiously assembled, has recently caused the Rumour Engine to break down. The [[Imperium]] has now asked the Many With Eyes to split the processing of the Rumour Engine's auguries amongst themselves. They all have been given a routine [[data wafer]] to conduct this task and each is encoded with a possibility of what the future may hold.{{Fn|1}}

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}

[[Image:VagabondTrader.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Vagabond Class Merchant Trader|Vagabond Merchant Trader]].]]

The '''Merchant Fleets''' are one of the three components of the [[Imperial Fleet]], along with the [[civil fleets]] and [[Imperial Navy|warfleets]].

== Overview ==
The Merchant Fleet is one of the oldest organizations in the [[Imperium]], predating the [[Emperor]]'s domain and dating back to the [[Dark Age of Technology]] itself when the original [[Merchant Charter]]s were issued as part of [[Human]]ity's expansion into the Galaxy. Unlike most Imperial organizations which constantly attempt to police and control humanity's domain, the Merchant Fleet deals only in trade and as a result is supremely wealthy.{{Fn|4}} The combined merchant fleets compose almost 90% of all the interstellar spacecraft in the [[Imperium]].  Each fleet is based in one of the five [[Segmentae Majoris]], and its administrative staff operate from the [[Segmentum Fortress]].  Although these fleet bases are huge ports equipped with docks, shipyards and repair facilities, their main function is to administer the fleets operating within their area.  Only a small proportion of ships ever travel to the Segmentum Fortress where they are theoretically based.{{Fn|1}} The overall headquarters of the Merchant Fleet is located at the [[Nexus Axiomatic]] on Terra.{{Fn|4}} Within the Nexus work the [[Magister Calculo Horarium]] which coordinate shipping travel across the Imperium.{{Fn|4a}}

Each merchant ship serves its fleet under an arrangement called a [[Merchant Charter]].{{Fn|2}} Not all charters are the same - some confer more power and responsibility to the ship's captain than others - but all types take the form of a feudal oath sworn to the fleet authorities on behalf of the Emperor.  A captain may not register his vessel with the fleet authorities until this oath has been sworn and a record of it entered at the Segmentum Fortress for that zone and on the Segmentum Fortress on [[Mars]].{{Fn|1}}

One of the positions in the [[Senatorum Imperialis]] is sometimes held by the [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]]. Though an unassuming position, the Speaker is both tremendously wealthy and powerful, for it is they who can devastate entire [[Sector]]'s simply by halting merchant trade. The Speaker commands the armed wing of the Merchant Fleet, the [[Praeses Mercatura]].{{Fn|4}}

[[Rogue Trader]]s do not fall under the purview of the Merchant Fleet, making them one of the few shipping entities not under its grip.{{Fn|4}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6517">'''Aureus Nahor''' is a nature goddess, whose religion once flourished on the [[Imperial]] world [[Regium]].{{Fn|1b}}
==History==
The cult flourished for a thousand years due to the corruption of [[Regium]]'s [[Planetary Governors]], which allowed Nahor's faith to spread across the world, and many temples were constructed in her honor. The Goddess' followers also honored her by planting seeds under their skin, while also caging their skin with tangled piercings of knotted wood and metal. A massive{{Fn|1c}} breed of [[Calefaction Pump|tree]] on the world were also the focal points of Nahor's religion{{Fn|1b}}, as they were treated as sacred sites of the Goddess{{Fn|1c}}. The trees' roots were also of much importance, as Nahor's dead worshipers were buried with them{{Fn|1b}} and placed within the trees' inner walls{{Fn|1c}}. Their sacred art also depicts the roots snaking down to encase the world's core{{Fn|1a}}. Her white, rune-stitched robed priests{{Fn|1c}}, known as the '''Keft'''{{Fn|1e}}, were the guardians of these world roots{{Fn|1d}} and claimed they formed a chamber within the core of Regium and would protect Aureus Nahor's followers in their times of need. Though the [[Emperor]] was treated as a separate god, Aureus Nahor's followers also worshiped Him and He played a part in the Goddess' mythology. According to the Keft, should Regium ever fall from the Emperor's grace, He would light a fire within its core that would tear the world apart.{{Fn|1e}}  

However Aureus Nahor's religion came to an end in [[M42]], when the [[Ultramarines]] [[Space Marine Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Varus Castamon]] led a large [[Imperial]] strike force to [[Regium]]. He was charged with turning it into a part of the Imperium's vital [[Sanctus Line]] and drastic change would need to be done to secure the world. This included having  Regium's [[Planetary Governor]] executed for corruption and also putting an end to Nahor's religion. [[Confessor]] [[Thurgau]] was largely in charge of this and though the Goddess' worshipers resisted at first, most stopped after the strike force gave them two revelations. The first, was that the Goddess trees, which were of such importance to her religion, were actually{{Fn|1b}} [[Geoengine]]s known as [[Calefaction Pump]]s, which had terraformed Regium so that it could support life{{Fn|1c}}. The second, was that those who refused to follow the Imperial Creed were destroyed by the Imperium. Nahor's worshipers were informed that would have been their fate, had the [[Ultramarines]] not been at the head of the strike force. Due to the [[Space Marines]]' presence and the revelations brought to them, the Goddess' worshipers were allowed the time to accept that their religion was no more. Their leader, [[Vela Zalth]], aided in this transition period and all this allowed Confessor Thurgau to convert the worshipers into the Imperial Creed, without a drop of blood being spilled.{{Fn|1b}} 

[[Thurgau]] also demanded, however, that Nahor's most holy temple be leveled and he later had the fortress city of '''Zarax''' built in its place. This was a statement of intent on the [[Confessor]]'s part, but the former worshiper [[Urzun]], claimed he could still hear the weeping of Nahor's tree roots from beneath the fortress. The worshipers' songs about Nahor were also banned, though the [[Imperium]] did have them written down in books. But even with the banning of her religion, the Goddess' presence was still felt on Regium{{Fn|1b}}. This included the world's depictions of the [[Emperor]], wearing a helmet bearing a crown of knotted branches and of Him wielding a [[Emperor's Sword (Weapon)|Sword]] that trailed leaves instead of flames{{Fn|1a}}. Nahor's former worshipers also continued the practice of skin piercings, and planting seeds underneath their skin, though they did so now in honor of the Emperor, whose blood they believe was made of tree sap. These were minor deviations to the Imperial Creed, were allowed to continue at that time.{{Fn|1b}} 

[[Vela Zalth]] was still a leader to the former worshipers, though she now bore the title of '''Proconsul'''. She did her best to temper those who resent having to stop worshiping the Goddess, which included her protÃ©gÃ© and successor, '''Consul''' [[Damaris (Consul)|Damaris]]. While Zalth understood their complaints and resentments against the Imperium, she was quick to remind them that Nahor and the [[Emperor]] were now one and the same. And also what their fate could have been, had they refused to embrace the Imperial Creed. For his part, though, Thurgau still worked to stamp out any deviations that still flourished amongst the Goddess' former worshipers. This included their skin piercings, planting seeds underneath their skin and believing the Emperor's blood was tree sap. [[Regium]]'s new [[Imperial Governor]], [[Seroc]], had told the Confessor to ignore this, as these deviations to the Imperial Creed were minor compared to how the worshipers now prayed to the Emperor. In Seroc's view, pressing the matter would only undo all the work Thurgau had done to end Nahor's religion. The Confessor though refused to do so, as he believed these minor deviations could later lead to larger ones, if they were allowed to fester.{{Fn|1b}}
{{Spoiler|source= Leviathan (Novel)}}
Despite this, however, the Goddess was still secretly worshiped and some of her '''Keft''' priests, even still gathered to honor the [[Calefaction Pump]]s as her sacred sites. This ultimately came to an end, though, when [[Hive Fleet Leviathan]] invaded the world. Ultimately, [[Space Marine Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Varus Castamon]]'s [[Imperial]] forces were not enough to save [[Regium]] and he gave the order to destroy it, so the world would not be consumed. His forces achieved this by throwing a reactor down what Aureus Nahor's followers called a world root, but was actually a pump from a [[Calefaction Pump]] machine. The resulting explosion started a chain reaction{{Fn|1e}}, that caused Regium to explode and only Castamon and four other [[Imperials]] survived the world's destruction. Regium's death also likely brought an end to Aureus Nahor's religion.{{Fn|1f}}

'''Necronomers''', are an order of historians that seek out places that honour the fallen warriors of the [[Imperium]]. There they record the deeds ascribed to them, and collect memories of the fallen. Such as iconic images and untold lore, things that are never recorded in traditional archives.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Nexus Axiomatic''' is a vast [[Terran]] fortress that is the headquarters of the [[Merchant Fleet]]s of the [[Imperium]] and the domain of the [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]].{{Fn|1a}}

A massive structure, the original foundations of the Nexus Axiomatic were laid down centuries before the [[Imperium]] was created. Every hereditary charter is issued from within the Nexus, and records detailing every statistic on transportation, tithe-collection and inter-system trade are housed there as well. As a result, the fortress contains billions of documents that its adepts store within depositories. The Nexus is also home to large transmitters that constantly collect and broadcast merchant shipping data from relay stations.{{Fn|1a}} Within the Nexus are the [[Magister Calculo Horarium]], horrifically genetically modified beings subsisting in vats whose duty it is to coordinate shipping traffic across the Imperium.{{Fn|1b}}

Many of its records were almost lost in the [[Siege of Terra]], when the forces of [[Horus]] nearly destroyed the Nexus, before the Traitors were defeated. In the [[Horus Heresy|Heresy]]'s aftermath, the Nexus was rebuilt overtime to its current form, and the Speaker created the armed [[Praeses Mercatura]] to ensure its protection. Unlike the decaying structure of many other edifices across Terra, the Nexus Axiomatic in [[M41]] continues to exude wealth and opulence, reflecting the fabulous riches of the Merchant Fleet.{{Fn|1a}}

Deep within the Nexus Axiomatic are a series of ancient murals depicting the history of space travel. The first image shows a robed figure overlooking the first [[Warp Engine]], the second is the same man this time appearing by the first [[Gellar Field]] generator. The third image shows a [[Dark Glass|Throne in the void]], while the fourth displays a fetus curled up in a cartouche-shaped vial with a flame burning in its forehead.{{Fn|1b}}

'''Nutrient Bars Twists''' are a type of [[Imperial]] food, that has been approved by the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] for servants of the [[Omnissiah]] to eat. It is possible for them to survive on a diet of nothing but the Bar Twists alone.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Officio Sabatorum''' is one of the smaller organizations that existed within the [[Imperium]].  While a certain amount of leeway is given regarding deaths and additional collateral damage throughout the course of an operation by the Sabatorum, direct assassination is not their mission.{{Fn|1}} This sets them apart from the [[Officio Assassinorum]].  Officio Sabatorum agents deal with sabotage and physical destruction rather than the elimination of specific targets.{{Fn|1}}

Covert agents of the Sabatorum are capable of killing everyone at an outpost with ease.  They favour the use of explosives, poisons and gas rather than conventional weapons.  Should an agent have to fight an opponent directly it is often viewed as a mission that has failed already.{{Fn|1}}

Employed throughout the Imperium, agents of the Officio Sabatorum were positively identified as having been used during the [[Third War for Armageddon]].{{Fn|2}}

[[Image:Elucidatum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An {{PAGENAME}} '''Tallyman'''{{Fn|2}}]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' were the secret police of [[Malcador the Sigillite]] during the [[Unification Wars]], [[Great Crusade]], and [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1}}

Known as the Elucidators or Tallymen, these officers operated openly as bureaucratic functionary's of the [[Administratum]] but covertly were iconoclasts charged with censorship and murder. Drawn from the finest military experts and warriors of the [[Sol System]], the Elucidators were highly specialized combatants and agents. Often posing as [[Remembrancer]]s, they accompanied [[Expeditionary Fleet]]s on the [[Great Crusade]] and compiled information on compliment civilizations. Of particular interest were the religious beliefs of civilizations, and they oversaw the destruction of holy texts, the assassination of demagogues, and the repression of faiths as part of the securing of the [[Imperial Truth]]. Eludicator Officers had status granted to them by Malcador that allowed them to requisition any military resources for their needs save that of the [[Legiones Astartes]].{{Fn|1}}

Over the Great Crusade, the Elucidators earned a dark reputation associated with genocide. They often used seratoxin &quot;Brain Destroyer&quot; drugs to destroy the minds of any witnesses to [[Warp]] activity. Their atrocities included wiping out entire lines of Imperial households as well as the annihilation of early [[Imperial Cult]]s.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Order of Interrogation'''{{Fn|2b}} was a new order of [[Remembrancer]]s, that [[Kyril Sindermann]] formed within the [[Imperial Palace]] while [[Terra]] was being [[Battle for Terra|invaded]], during the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1a}}
==History==
This was done with the [[Primarch]] [[Dorn]]'s permission{{Fn|1a}}, after [[Kyril Sindermann|Sindermann]] agreed to the condition that he would no longer spread the teachings of the [[Lectitio Divinitatus]]{{Fn|2a}}. The Order of Interrogation was charged with recording the events of the [[Battle for Terra]] and with interrogating various Imperials who took part in it{{Fn|1b}}. This was so that the battle's history could be preserved for future generations of the Imperium to study{{Fn|2a}}. The Primarch Dorn ordered the Hurscarl Diamantis to aid the Order in this task{{Fn|1a}} and he supplied them with various materials. This included folders filled with places for the Interrogators to visit, disposition permits, travel waivers and grants of authority so they could be dispersed among the defending Imperial forces. While the Interrogators were free to chose where they wanted to go, the Hurscarl Diamantis informed Sindermann he did not have that option. This was done on the orders of Dorn himself, who had specific places he wanted Sindermann to go to. Dorn did permit Sindermann, however, to take other Interrogates with him on these missions. While [[Euphrati Keeler]] was also a member of the Order, she was held within the [[Blackstone (Prison)â€Ž|Blackstone]] prison, due to her [[heresy]] involving the Lectitio Divinitatus as well. Her role as an Interrogator did not supersede the [[Sigillite]]'s standing order that Keeler not be allowed to leave the prison. She would be permitted to leave her cell and interview the other prisoners held within Blackstone, though. However the [[Legio Custodes|Custodian]] [[Amon Tauromachian]] would always be by her side, to ensure Keeler did not try to escape.{{Fn|1b}}

'''Pankration''' is an [[Imperial]] martial arts style, that is practiced by [[Space Marines]]. It can also be programmed into [[Tractoris Servitor]]s, so that Space Marines can spar against them.{{Fn|1}} 
==Description==
It is a pugilist style, which consists of a series of 87 pattern of punches, which get faster with each swing. When done correctly, Pankration practitioners' fists will make short, sharp noises in the air and they can also exhale cries that will help them add power to their blows. When they are not attacking, practitioners will always have their arms up to protect their face. The exact age of Pankration's creation is unknown, but it was included in the combat programs for the first generation of [[Primaris Space Marine]]s. This was done via real life training and virtual stimulation, through the use of [[Hypnomat]] memory implantation.{{Fn|1}}  

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
[[Wikipedia:Pankration|Pankration]] was a sporting event introduced into the Greek Olympic Games in 648 BC, which was an empty-hand submission sport with few rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">{{ImperiumPortal}}
'''Pirates''' are a common and numerous threat to the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

==Overview==
Usually dwelling in isolated regions of space, these areas naturally attract renegades, exiles, and mercenaries. Without the guidance of the [[Emperor]], this drudge of humanity often fall to the powers of [[Chaos]]. However many do not, instead opting for a life of plunder. Hiding away on fringe worlds, moons, or in asteroid belts these men form pirate fleets. Their ranks are filled with deserters from the [[Imperial Guard]] and [[Imperial Navy]] as well as those fleeing from the [[Adeptus Arbites]]. Many are also anti-Imperial insurgents, who see themselves as freedom fighters against the tyranny of the [[Adeptus Terra]].{{Fn|1}}

Pirate bases act as safe havens for every criminal, miscreant, heretic, and rebel throughout the Imperium. Such bases are a constant bane to the Imperium, often serving as epicenters for raiding outposts and isolated colonies. However most pirates survive by living off the plunder acquired through raiding Imperial [[Merchant Fleet]]s. When faced with the firepower of the Imperial Navy however most Pirates will opt to flee, for they lack the heavy firepower or capital ships of the [[Imperial Fleet]]. However due to their hit-and-run attacks and guerrilla tactics, Pirates are usually able to stay one step ahead of the Imperial Navy.{{Fn|1}}

Such is the level of piracy in the Imperium's space lanes that one of the prime duties of the Imperial Navy is to hunt down pirate bases and keep shipping lanes safe for Merchant ships. It is important for the Imperial Navy to destroy pirate bases early, for they have been known to grow exponentially as a successful pirate fleet gains more followers, glory, and plunder. Eventually an unchecked pirate fleet could even check Imperial rule at the [[System]] level.{{Fn|1}}

==Leadership==
Pirate leaders find it difficult to control their wayward forces, and thus a fleet will often be made up of many different factions and individual warlords looking out for themselves as opposed to combining efforts for the common good. As such it's little surprise that infighting and backstabbing are common among pirate fleets.{{Fn|1}}

==Tactics==
Pirates prefer to operate in 'Wolf Packs', small squadrons of swift craft which will launch an ambush against unprotected targets. Wolf Packs often operate in areas where the Imperial Navy is already embattled against heretics or [[xenos]], forcing the Imperium to divert ships to stop their raiding. Usually when faced with Imperial warships, pirate Wolf Packs prefer to scatter and fight another day.{{Fn|1}}

Pirates will rarely strike or operate in deep space, such regions lack plunder and are often extremely hazardous. At the same time they will rarely raid a world or the space around it, where orbital defenses and [[Defense Monitor]]s can quickly respond to their threats. Instead, pirates prefer to strike in shipping lanes and sparsely inhabited regions of Imperial space.{{Fn|1}}

==Ships==
Pirate ships are often converted and modified [[Imperial Transport]]s or [[Armed Freighter]]s. However many more are captured small Imperial Navy [[escort]] craft or older light vessels.{{Fn|1}}

Commonly encountered Pirate ships include:{{Fn|1}}
*[[Iconoclast Class Destroyer]]
*[[Idolator Class Raider]]
*[[Sword Class Frigate]]
*[[Firestorm Class Frigate]]
*[[Cobra Class Destroyer]]
*[[Defense Monitor]]s
*[[Escort Carrier]]
*[[Fire Ship]]
*[[Q-Ship]]

==Non-Human Pirates==
*[[Dark Eldar]]
*[[Eldar Corsair]]s
*[[Ork]] [[Freebooterz]]
*[[Chaos Space Marine]] Warbands (mostly notably the [[Red Corsairs]])

==Famous Pirates==

*[[Dorian Corsairs]]{{Fn|4}}
*Prince [[Hellanieth]] - [[Eldar]].  So-called '''Pirate King'''{{Fn|2}}

Each ploin has green skin, pink flesh and black pips.{{Fn|1}} They are often brewed into a non-alcoholic beverage popular with many explorers as it is nutrient-rich, capable of combating many common illnesses brought on by the habitual poor diets inherent to extended space travel.{{Fn|2}}

When cheaply fermented, ploins produce a clear, strong drink commonly known as '''&quot;wobble&quot;''' â€” as this is both what the fruit does when set upright, as well as what most users do after imbibing.{{Fn|2}}

The '''Polarists''' are a faction within the [[Imperium]] who trace their origins to the monograph written by [[Eparch Kvander]].

== History ==
This faction believe in the polarity between [[Human]] and [[Psyker]]. Though they believe in the [[Emperor]] being divine and  transcendent, it is said that the only way Humans and Psykers can meet is at the Godhead as He holds Mankind and witchery in His hands as proof of his godhood. However, this group believe that any mortal who is a mixture between a Psyker and a Human is a mockery. Thus, the Polarists feel that it is their duty to enforce the polarity between the two. They believe that if a person is a Human than they can pray, act and talk as a Human. But if they are a Psyker, than they are fit for that single role and thus must be bereft of all Humanity. Those Astropaths that are within the hands of a Polarist face being trepanned and lobotomised whereupon they are reduced to being little more than a psychic [[Servitor]].

Polarists feel that those Psykers that have their brains burnt out by the [[Soul Binding]] are the pure ones as they feel that is what the Emperor intended for them. Whilst those that survive it intact and become both strong as well as proud are seen as being  abberations who must face the polarity by being forcibly reduced to being little more than an instrument controlled by its master devoid of all feeling. Those that face this act are said to barely able to perform a choir and that ciphers are placed within their head allowing others to control them as if they are a musical organ. In such a state, they are treated just as a servitor is treated and the Polarists feel that this is the correct course of action as it is what the Emperor intended for Psykers. Those that face this fate are said to be incapable of performing even a millionth of the work other psykers are capable of with their complete mind.

The message of the group was later spread by the [[Missionaria Galaxia]] which led to it being accepted by members of the [[Imperial Navy]] and [[Ecclesiarchy]] on [[Chiros]]. It is said that the [[Inquisition]] has faced a growing corruption by the beliefs of the Polarists with a commander of a [[Black Ship]] being said to be one of their members. There are even some followers within the [[Adeptus Astropathica]] itself.{{Fn|1}}

They are scattered across the surface, during an eruption and are invaluable to the [[Imperium]]. This is because the Power Crystals are used in the creation of Imperial battle armor and the best quality ones, are said to come from [[Karkason (Mining World)|Karkason]].{{Fn|1}}

Clad in midnight blue, the {{PAGENAME}} ultimately answer to the [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]] and protect the Speaker's personal domain on [[Terra]], known as the [[Nexus Axiomatic]]. The Mercatura's formation dates back to the aftermath of the [[Siege of Terra]], where the Nexus was nearly destroyed before [[Horus]]' forces were defeated. To ensure that never happened again, the Speaker created the Mercatura and armed them with ancient weaponry and technology, to wield in the rebuilt Nexus' defense.{{Fn|1}}

The {{PAGENAME}} are a lightly armed force designed around protection and internal security, with its infantry wearing little armor and being armed with [[Lasgun]]s and [[Laspistol]]s. They also utilize gunships and [[Gun-Servitor]]s.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Primarch's Scourge''' was the name given to the brutal purges that began on [[Terra]], after [[Lord Commander]] [[Guilliman]] attempted to destroy its corrupt population, in the wake of the [[Great Rift]]'s creation. 

The purge was to ensure that [[Terra]] served as a solid bastion from which Guilliman could launch his [[Indomitus Crusade]] from. With the full permission of the [[High Lords]] and with the aid of numerous Imperial forces, the Scourge struck Terra's [[Hives]] and led to the outbreak of a series of wars. What followed was the destruction of hundreds of both [[Xenos]] and [[Chaos Cults]], as well as millions of [[heretics]], [[mutants]], and recidivists. This also led to a shocking number of corrupt officials, dilettante cult-magisters, and self-interested high acolytes, being culled from Terran high society. Though the Scourge caused significant collateral damage to the Imperium's Homeworld as well as murmurings of discontent, the Indomitus Crusade's fleets later went mainly uninterrupted by sabotage, sedition, or politicking.{{Fn|1}}

Four [[High Lords of Terra]] were removed. These were [[Master of the Administratum]] [[Irthu Haemotalion]], [[Paternoval Envoy]] [[Uila Lamma]], [[Speaker for the Chartist Captains]] [[Kania Dhanda]], and [[Ecclesiarch]] [[Baldo Slyst]]. A fifth High Lord, [[Master of the Astronomican]] [[Leops Franck]], was killed during the chaos of the [[Noctis Aeterna]] and replaced by Guilliman's own choice.{{Fn|3}} In addition, hundreds of lesser lords of the [[Senatorum Imperialis]] were removed.{{Fn|2}} One of the most high profile of these lesser victims was [[Horron Sch'est]], the Consul Pre-eminus of the [[Navis Nobilite]], who was publicly flogged on Guilliman's orders.{{Fn|2}}

On [[Necromunda (planet)|Necromunda]], they are used by [[gang]]s to increase their reputations and help with recruiting new members.

'''Raenka''' is a highly prized brandy made from fermented [[Ploin Juice]] and crafted through careful distillation in used [[amasec]] barrels. On several [[feudal world]]s, it is a main export and secures a great percentage of yearly revenues. Prized for its rich dark yellow hue and subtle bouquet, raenka connoisseurs eagerly watch for news each season on the stages of ageing and which areas are releasing their vintages. Many traders make a small but tidy profit carrying barrels by special request from fermentation yards to impatient buyers willing to circumvent the normal flow of the liqueur.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Recorder of the Rolls''' is a [[Scribe]] who accompanies [[Lord Commander]] [[Guilliman]], during ceremonies and writes down his words in the Lord's personal copy of the [[Index Astartes]].{{Fn|1}} 
==Description==
Due to its massive size, though, [[Guilliman]]'s [[Index Astartes]] is carried by a group of [[Imperial]]s known as the [[Index Bearers]]. When the Recorder services are needed, the Bearers carry out not only the Index, but also a large stand to hold it, as well as a small table to put the Recorder's needed bottles of ink and numerous pens on. The Recorder will then cast a critical eye over everything's placement and if it meets with their approval, the Bearers will reverently open the Index to a blank page. When all is ready, the Recorder will signal to [[Lord Commander]] Guilliman that they are ready, to record his words. When the Lord Commander oversees the [[Founding]] of new [[Chapter]]s, the Recorder will not only write down Guilliman's words, but also the reason why the Chapter was formed. The Recorder will also record its officers' oaths to serve the [[Imperium]], their personal heraldries and the Chapter's symbol. Once the ceremony is over, the Index Bearers will carry the Index and everything else away, until it is needed again. The information the Recorder wrote about a Chapter's Founding, will then be [[Astropath|Astropathetically]] sent throughout the entire Imperium, so that it can be recorded in other copes of the Index Astartes. The Recorder of the Rolls and the Index Bearers also conducted their duties, over the course of the [[Indomitus Crusade]] and were stationed within Guilliman's [[Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus]].{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:Minst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A {{PAGENAME}}]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}s''' are [[Imperial]] medical specialists trained to prolong life.

Closely based on the [[Orders Hospitaller]] of the [[Adepta Sororitas]], the Rejuvenant Adepts focus not only on healing but also on longevity and sham immortality. As a result, their talents are greatly sought after by the wealthy and powerful within the Imperium. They are found throughout many Imperial agencies, but are of special use to [[Rogue Traders]] whose voyages take decades or even centuries.{{Fn|1}}

Rejuvenat Adepts use complex programs of rejuvenat treatments, steroidal elixirs, and anti-thanators in their science, extending the lifespands of their patrons for centuries past their normal limit. Without theses specialized personnel, even the [[High Lords of Terra]] would die within a normal human lifespan.{{Fn|1}}

On the battlefield, Rejuvenat Adepts act as emergency surgeons, healing serious wounds and administering pain killers. While the members of the Orders Hospitaller takw vows of non-violence, this is not the case with Rejuvenant Adepts and they are armed with sharpened claws and [[Laspistol]]s.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Remembrancer Order''' was a group of poets, journalists, imagists and writers that were sent to accompany the [[Imperial]] forces during the later years of the [[Great Crusade]], once the [[Emperor]] had returned to [[Terra]].{{Fn|1}}

== History ==
During the [[Great Crusade]], various chroniclers and recorders had been accompanying Imperial forces as individuals, but their records were piecemeal and irregular. Following the victory at Ullanor, it was decided that a more formal and authoritative celebration of mankind's reunification was needed.{{Fn|1}} The Order of Remembrancers was ratified by the Council of Terra following a petition by [[Solomon Voss]], with the aid of [[Askarid Sha]], directly to the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] with the goal of forming an order of people to be the Imperium's memory of its foundation and reflect the truth of the Great Crusade.{{Fn|17}} The remembrancers were recruited from all levels of Terran society and from the societies of other key Imperial worlds, based on the merit of their creative gifts. Almost 4.3 million remembrancers were sent abroad in the first months following the ratification of the bill, assigned to join all the key expedition fleets active in the expanding Imperium.{{Fn|1}}

However they were generally disliked by both the regular troops and the [[Astartes]]. [[Leman Russ (Primarch)|Leman Russ]], [[Primarch]] of the [[Space Wolves]], was rumoured to have groused that all remembrancers should be given weapons if they wanted to be on the front lines.{{Fn|1}}

When the [[Horus Heresy]] began, the Imperium issued the '''Edict of Dissolution''' which officially dissolved the Order of Remembrancers and removed the status they once held; though the reason for the Dissolution was kept from the former Remembrancers. Further, on the orders of [[Malcador]], they were to be immediately sent to [[Terra]], where they would be debriefed by his office.{{Fn|11}} Later on during the [[Siege of Terra]] Dorn and Malcador agreed to [[Order of Interrogation|restore the Remembrancer Order]] under [[Kyril Sindermann]]. This time, the Remembrancer's symbol was the [[Inquisitorial]] &quot;I&quot;, representing their role as interrogators as they now interviewed subjects for historical documentation.{{Fn|16b}}

It is not known what happened to the records they made during the Great Crusade, except that by the [[41st Millennium]] they had been either entirely destroyed or otherwise concealed.{{Cite This}}

==Modern Remembrancers==
*{{Main|Logos Historica Verita}}
In the 41st Millennium, the title of Remembrancer is still used, although how it came to be used again is unknown. These &quot;modern&quot; remembrancers appear to record the history of the [[Imperium]], much like the remembrancers of the [[Great Crusade]]. However, unlike remembrancers of the Great Crusade, &quot;modern&quot; remembrancers do not appear to accompany Imperial armies into the field.{{Fn|7b}} One example of an [[M41]]-era remembrancer was [[Tremault]], who wrote the ''[[The Accounts of the Tallarn]]''.{{Fn|7a}}

Following the resurrection of [[Roboute Guilliman]] at the end of the [[Ultramar Campaign]], the [[Primarch]] made [[Lev Tieron]] his personal Remembrancer.{{Fn|13}}

The '''Ring of Fifty''' are 50 [[Imperial]] Zeta-class [[Astropathic Relay Stationâ€Ž]]s in [[Segmentum Solar]], that surround [[Terra]]. Because they are considered to be a lynchpin in the governance of the entire Imperium, the Ring is under the close supervision of the [[Adeptus Astra Telepathica]].{{Fn|1}}

{{redirect|Becoming|the short story by [[Andy Clark]]|Becoming (Short Story)}}
The '''Ritual of Becoming''' is a key event in the training of an [[Imperial Knight]].{{Fn|1}}

When a Noble of a [[Knight House]] reaches their 18th year, they must undergo the Ritual of Becoming, an event that is viewed with great honour and solemnity.  Inside the house's sanctuary, they are connected to one of the vacant [[Throne Mechanicum]].  They are then left, typically for a full night, alone.  The young aspirant must wrestle with the energies of the Throne Mechanicum, attempting to imprint their psyche upon it without being overwhelmed by its cerebral engrams in turn.  Sometimes the process is enough to drive the aspirant mad, other times they are killed outright.  Those who survive are forever changed, their childhood left behind and the mantle of knighthood now resting heavily upon their shoulders.{{Fn|1}}

'''Rogue Factoria''' are [[Imperial]] factories that are used by criminal organizations to create counterfeit weaponry and wargear.{{Fn|1a}} 
==Description==
Though the counterfeits are cheaply produced, selling them is a very lucrative enterprise for criminals. Rogue Factoria also have the added benefit of keeping their owners' allies well-equipped with ordnance{{Fn|1a}}. They are overseen by '''Factoria Overseers''', with '''Work Party Bosses''' charged with overseeing the '''Factoria Workers''' who create the counterfeit goods. These workers are motley groups of miscreants, that are gathered from wherever their Rogue Factoria masters can find them. On [[Hive Worlds]], some are criminals who work in the Rogue Factoria, in order to pay off their debts to their [[Underhive]] criminal bosses. Others are escapes from Uphive, who had sought freedom and wealth, but instead found a new life that was much like their old one. When the owners of the Rogue Factoria need to help their allies or defend their Factoria, they will arm a group of Workers, with cast-off weaponry, and send them into battle. This ad hoc militia, known as a '''Factoria Work Gang''', is led by a Factoria Overseer, with a Work Party Boss serving as their second in command. However the life of Factoria Worker is of little consequence to the Rogue Factoria's criminal owners. As a result, they are considered expendable and will be used as fodder to protect the Rogue Factoria. The Workers can also be loaned out to serve as expendable troops in the battles of the owners' allies{{Fn|1b}}. The [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] is also always on the look out, for those who create and use counterfeit [[Imperial]] goods.{{Fn|1a}} 

==Necromunda==
On [[Necromunda (planet)|Necromunda]], Rogue Factorias are used by the more nefarious elements of [[House Cawdor]]. These natural scavengers and notorious misers make great use of the Factoria's counterfeit goods. However just like on other [[Imperial]] worlds, the eye of the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] is own Necromunda. Those found using a Rogue Factoria's goods will find that the [[Hive World]]'s [[Guilders]] have placed a bounty on their heads, for the Mechanicus.{{Fn|1a}}

The ''' Rumour Engine''' was an [[Imperial]] [[cogitator]] that created small images, that were glimpses into the future.{{Fn|1}}
==History==
Those who have seen it, claim the Rumour Engine bears a startling resemblance to the [[League of Votann]]'s [[Ancestor Cores]], including having bearded faces that have been carved into the [[cogitator]]'s sides{{Fn|2}}. Some even claimed the device was sentient. However the sheer amount of inscrutable future-derived data the cogitator repetitiously assembled, has recently caused the Rumour Engine to break down. The [[Imperium]] has now asked its attendees, known as the [[Many With Eyes]], to split the processing of the Rumour Engine's auguries amongst themselves. They all have been given a routine [[data wafer]] to conduct this task and each is encoded with a possibility of what the future may hold.{{Fn|3}}
==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
The ''Rumour Engine'' is a feature of [[Warhammer Community]] articles, that offer hints of upcoming miniatures that [[Games Workshop]] will release. The images shown are said to have been displayed by the Rumour Engine itself.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Sanctus Line''' is an [[Imperial]] region of [[Segmentum Pacificus]], that was turned into a massive defensive fortification in [[M42]], due to sharing a border with [[Segmentum Solar]]. It is ultimately designed to prevent the Imperium's enemies from invading the [[Sol System]] and threatening [[Terra]] itself.{{Fn|1a}} 
==Description==
Key worlds within the Sanctus Line have been heavily fortified by [[Imperial]] strike forces, whose commanders have been charged with defending them. Once given a world to protect, their commanders are authorized to take all measures to secure them and will use their strike forces to end any threats or weaknesses the worlds may contain{{Fn|1a}}{{Fn|1b}}. This includes even executing [[Planetary Governor]]s that are perceived to have failed in their duties. These worlds are also required to provide a tithe to the Sanctus Line, so that it can continue to carry out its function of protecting the Sol System{{Fn|1b}}. However because of this, the Sanctus Line is often attacked by the Imperium's foes who wish to invade [[Terra]].{{Fn|1a}}
{{Spoiler|source= Leviathan (Novel)}}
The Sanctus Line world [[Regium]] has since been lost, though, due to an invasion by [[Hive Fleet Leviathan]]. In order to prevent it from being consumed, however, Regium's commander, [[Space Marine Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Varus Castamon]], sought to cause the world to explode and also destroy the [[Hive Fleet]] in the process{{Fn|1c}}. The resulting explosion did just that, but only Castamon and four other Imperials survived Regium's [[Dead World|destruction]]. There is now a hole in the Sanctus Line, though, and the Lieutenant is warning its other worlds of Regium's loss.{{Fn|1d}} 
==Known Worlds==
*[[Sanctum]] - One of the most formidable worlds of the Sanctus Line and homeworld of the [[White Templars]].
*[[Regium]] - A former{{Fn|1d}} cornerstone of the Sanctus Line, whose [[Manufactorum|manufactories]] provided it with vital fuel and ammunition. The [[Ultramarines]] [[Space Marine Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Varus Castamon]], was the commander of the [[Imperial]] forces defending the world{{Fn|1b}}, before it was [[Dead World|destroyed]].{{Fn|1d}}

The '''Sangua-Terran War Council''' is a [[Gorandahl Sub-sector]] coalition of military and religious leaders, that was formed to stabilize the [[Sub-sector]] in the wake of the [[Great Rift]]'s creation.{{Fn|1}}  
==History==
It was created by [[Imperial Commander]] [[Kalendela Tol]] and aided the remaining [[Imperial]] [[System]]s of the [[Gorandahl Sub-sector]], until contact with the wider Imperium was made. Bitter years of warfare followed, but the [[Sub-sector]] became relatively stable. The later discovery of the [[Nachmund Gauntlet]] would make Gorandahl's safety a priority for the Imperium and it became used to send supplies to the important world of [[Vigilus]]. The Council, though, became overstretched as they complied with their new orders, while also protecting the Sub-sector from the Imperium's enemies. Word has now spread, however, that [[Abaddon the Despoiler]] has now [[Nachmund Rift War|sent his forces down]] the Nachmund Gauntlet and the [[Heretics]] would soon fall upon Gorandahl.{{Fn|1}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Imperial]] religious holiday.

Perhaps the most revered day on the Imperial Calendar, Sanguinala commemorates the sacrifice of the [[Primarch]] [[Sanguinius]].{{Fn|1}}

==Trivia==
Within the Warhammer 40,000 community and fandom, Sanguinala is often parodied as the in-universe equivalent of Christmas.{{Fn|1}}  The name Sanguinala itself having origins in the Roman feast [[Wikipedia:Saturnalia|Saturnalia]], which was said to be a major influence in the formation of the Christmas holiday.

[[Image:ScarAB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Scar/AB operatives utilizing forbidden [[Xenos]] wargear{{Fn|1}}]] 
The '''Scar/AB''' are a mysterious clandestine [[Imperial]] unit, whose operatives specialize in terror tactics including night attacks, trophy taking and worse.{{Fn|1}} 
==History==
Their motivations for these dire acts remain unknown, as is who or what organization the Scar/AB work for. It is known, however, that the Scar/AB wield [[Imperial]] weapons whose maker's stamps have been filed off and also make use of forbidden [[Xenos]] weapons and technology. The unit is led on their missions by a shadowy woman known as the [[Matriarch Firebrand]], who exhibits an unnatural control over her fellow operatives. Many [[Inquisition]] agents have died trying to learn exactly where the Matriarch gets her orders from.{{Fn|1}}
==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
The ''Scar/AB'' and the [[Matriarch Firebrand]] were created by the [[Games Workshop]] employee [[Tammy Nicholls]] and they were featured in [[Warhammer: Visions 18]].{{Fn|1}}

'''Sector Lords''' are the ruling [[Imperial Commander]] of a [[Sector]] and [[Sub-Sector]]s of space.{{Fn|1}} Their duties are similar to that of a Planetary [[Governor]], but encompass multiple systems or multiple [[Sub-Sector]]s. Sector Lords themselves come from a variety of backgrounds such as nobility{{Fn|1}} or the [[Ecclesiarchy]]{{Fn|2}}.

[[Image:SegGalacticPic.jpg|right]]

The space ruled by the [[Imperium]] is divided into five fleet zones known as the '''Segmentae Majoris'''.{{Fn|2}}  The galaxy is such a vast place that it would be unmanageable without this system.

==Overview==
Each '''Segmentum''' has its own [[Imperial Navy]] and [[Merchant Fleet]]s, as well as a [[Segmentum Fortress]] or [[Segmentum Naval Base]] that forms the base of fleet operations within the Segmentum.  The Segmentum fleet commanders are known as the [[Lord High Admiral]]s.{{Fn|1}} The Segmentum Fortress is controlled directly by a high-ranking official of the [[Administratum]] known as the [[Administratum Master|Master]] of the Segmentum.{{Fn|1}}

Although intended for purposes of fleet administration and shipping controls, the Segmentae have evolved into administrative divisions of the [[Adeptus Terra]].{{Fn|1}}

The Segmentae Majoris and their fortresses are:

[[Image:Sensei.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Sensei with Shotgun{{Fn|2}}]]
The '''Sensei''' are the true immortal sons of the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] who wander the galaxy as heroes and champions.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|2}}

== History ==
Long before the birth of the [[Imperium]], the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] lived in hiding amongst ordinary men and during this time he fathered many families. The Emperor's sons, like their father, possessed special abilities of their own. While their father was a powerful [[psyker]], the Sensei are psychic [[blanks]] and cannot be seen by other psykers. Due to their nature, the Emperor himself is also unaware of their relationship.{{Fn|1}} Not all of the Emperor's descendants are ''Sensei'', but the genes inherited by the Sensei from the Emperor have granted them the gift of immortality. While the Sensei were sired by the Emperor, they themselves are infertile and the Emperor has no further descendants.{{Fn|1}}&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;{{Fn|2}}

The Sensei have adapted to living in hiding within the ranks of humanity, while ignorant of their true heritage. Over the millenia they have been villified as 'witches' and 'devils' for their immortality.{{Fn|1}} The Sensei are heroes who wander the galaxy, sometimes in the company of bands of other powerful heroes.{{Fn|2}} In the age of the [[Imperium]], few other than the Sensei themselves and the [[Illuminati]] are aware of their existence, other than as folk tales of the ''[[Captain Eternal]]'' or the ''[[Wandering Inquisitor]]''.{{Fn|1}}

== Powers and Abilities ==
Only when a Sensei encounters, or is drawn to, another Sensei does the truth emerge and they are taught new abilities. They may tap into [[Warp|warpspace]] to channel energy for combat, sense [[Daemon|daemons]] or disturbances in the warp, and the power to mask their presence from [[Psyker|psychics]]. Trained Sensei are inducted into the ''[[Brotherhood (Sensei)|Brotherhood]]'' and prepare for the final battle against [[Chaos]]. Some Sensei may flee to join the forces of Chaos and become ''[[Grey Sensei]]'', becoming amongst the cruelest of dark servants.{{Fn|1}}

While a Sensei can be killed, they do not age. In addition they possess amazing powers of recovery. They are protected from the powers of [[Chaos]] and the [[Warp|warp]], but they may join the forces of Chaos{{Fn|1}}&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;{{Fn|2}}. A Sensei cannot experience hate, bitterness, or irrational anger, because these are emotions caused by the disharmony of the Chaos powers. The Sensei are invisible to the Chaos powers and their [[Daemon|daemons]] and possess no emotions that are embodied by the Chaos powers.{{Fn|2}}

The Sensei are rewarded with powers from the [[Star Child]] in the same way a [[Champion of Chaos]] may be rewarded by a [[Chaos God]].{{Fn|2}}.

==The Sensei and the Star Child==
Whereas the [[Chaos Gods]] possess their own [[Champion of Chaos|champions]], the Sensei act as the champions of the [[Star Child]], the immortal soul of the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] and humanity. Every Sensei is born with the ''[[Mark of the Star Child]]'', allowing them to draw upon the energy of the Star Child.{{Fn|2}} The Star Child may reward the Sensei with a number of different abilities and protections, such as the power to slay [[Daemon|daemons]], sword mastery, marksmanship, endurance, and mastery of disguise amongst other rewards.{{Fn|2}}

In time, a Sensei may achieve [[Apotheosis]], being drawn through the [[Warp|warp]] to commune with the [[Star Child]] to become one of its special servants, known as a ''[[Sensei Master]]''. A Sensei Master is the Star Child's equivalent of a [[Chaos God]]'s [[Daemon Prince]]. However, a Sensei's individuality and mind is consumed, and they may return to the material universe unnoticed, even visiting mortal friends if in danger.{{Fn|2}}

== Sensei Adventurer Bands ==
The Sensei will sometimes be in the company of a select band of other powerful heroes. To the [[Inquisition]], the Sensei are dangerous [[Psyker|psykers]] and [[Mutant|mutants]], and them and their bands risk capture and death at the hands of the Inquisition or other [[Imperium|Imperial forces]]. While the Sensei are not enemies of the Imperium in and of itself, they are enemies of oppression, often giving them popular support.{{Fn|2}}

These Adventurer Bands may hide in underground caverns, deep within cities, or lead freedom fighters from the forests and mountains. Others work as pirates, robbing vessels as champions against the rich and for the poor. These bands see themselves as the enemies of both [[Chaos]] and repression.{{Fn|2}}

Adventurer bands will consist of at least one Sensei, rebel human leaders and [[Psyker|psykers]], [[Abhumans|abhumans]] such as [[Squat]] rebel leaders or [[Ogryns]] from beyond the [[Imperium]], [[Navigators]], and even lone [[Eldar]] who have left their [[Craftworld]]. The Sensei generally possess strong emotional attachments to their comrades, and will return to assist them even after apotheosis with the [[Star Child]].{{Fn|2}}

== The Sensei and the Inquisition ==
The Sensei are regarded as dangerous [[Mutants|mutants]] by the [[Inquisition]], and assumed to be in league with the forces of [[Chaos]].{{Fn|1}} Even if not in league with the forces of Chaos, the Inquisition consider the Sensei and their followers as dangerous bandits, nihilists, and [[Psykers|psykers]] who are weakening the bulwark the [[Imperium]] has set against the forces of Chaos. Thus the Sensei and their Adventurer Bands always run the risk of engaging the Inquisition and Imperial forces.{{Fn|2}}

In 3928997.[[M41]], the [[Inquisition]] encountered a group of self-proclaimed Sensei on the world of [[Levilnor IV]], leading a cult known as the ''[[Temple of the Star Child]]'' (also known for short as the ''[[Star Cult]]''). The temple worshipped the Emperor in the form of the [[Star Child]]. While the investigating [[Inquisitor]] [[Fortez]] considered the possibility that they may in fact have been the children of the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]], he rejected the notion due to their association with rebel humans, [[Abhumans|abhumans]] and [[Eldar]].{{Fn|3}}

During the [[Inquisition War]], the '''Dark Master''' of the [[Ordo Malleus]] has established the [[Eternity Project]], whose goal is to hunt down the ''immortal mutants''.{{Fn|6b}}

The Sensei of the Temple followed the belief of achieving Apotheosis and be granted eternal life and everlasting power by the [[Star Child]]. This has led the [[Inquisition]] to believe that the cult is similar to the [[Tzeentch|Tzeentchian]] [[Thrandos cult]], and that the ''Great Sorcerer'' was perhaps masquerading as the Star Child. The cult on [[Levilnor IV]] was exterminated by the [[Salamanders]] [[Space Marine]] [[Chapter]], but there remain other Sensei which did not travel to Levilnor IV.{{Fn|3}}

Inquisitor [[Jaq Draco]] of the [[Ordo Malleus]] had heard the tales of the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]]'s immortal, true children as he was being pulled into an [[Illuminati]] plot.{{Fn|6a}}. Ultimately however, he remained unsure if the Emperor's true children truly exist or not.{{Fn|4b}}

===The Sensei and the Illuminati===
The [[Illuminati|Illuminati's]] goal is to renew the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] at the moment his body or mind finally fail. To achieve their ends, they gather Sensei in order to sacrifice them at the pivotal moment in which the Emperor is to fall. The Sensei who join the Illuminati are fooled into believing they will participate in the final battle against [[Chaos]], with the Illuminati even helping to establish a ''[[Long Watch]]'' of ''[[Sensei Knights]]'' who will participate in the 'last battle against Chaos'.{{Fn|1}}

The Illuminati believe that when the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] absorbs the souls of the Sensei, just as he absorbs the souls of countless of [[Psykers|psykers]], he will arise as the new ''[[Sensei-Emperor]]''{{Fn|1}} or the [[Star Child]]{{Fn|2}} to lead mankind. Until then, the Illuminati await the rebirth of the ''[[New Man]]''.{{Fn|2}}

[[Zephro Carnelian]], a member of the Illuminati, has speculated that as divisions exist within the Illuminati, between the mainline members and the [[Ordo Hydra]], there may be another sect of the Illuminati attempting to establish a true [[Long Watch]].{{Fn|4a}}

==The Sensei and Other Factions==
{{GW-Italy}}
Besides their Adventurer Bands, the Sensei may ally with other races and factions as part of their greater effort against the forces of Chaos. These include the Eldar, and especially the [[Harlequins]], who wish to closely observe the cause of the [[Star Child]]. They may be joined by defectors from the [[Tau Empire]] who have abandoned the cause of the [[Greater Good]] and view the Sensei and '''[[Ronin]]''' as the only true hope for a radiant future. Human allies may include the ranks of the [[Adeptus Astartes]], [[Sisters of Battle]], [[Imperial Guard]], and abhumans such as [[Ogryn]], [[Ratlings]], and [[Squats]].{{Fn|5}}

The '''Sisters of the Void''' are a benevolent all-female [[Imperial Cult|cult]] who spend much of their time plying the space-routes between worlds, helping travelers and crew to deal with the stresses of the [[warp]].  Few captains would refuse passage to a Sister and most crews readily welcome their presence. Formed unofficially as a group of clerics and priests to help travelers, they were eventually recognized and sanctioned by the [[Ecclesiarchy]]. Since that time, their numbers have continued to swell. The Sisters can mostly be found on pilgrim trails, though there is a chance of encountering them on any [[Imperial]] vessel.{{Fn|1}} 

No one knows why the cult only allows female members, although it has been rumoured that it has something to do with the nature of [[warp]] travel. There is an old, though unproven, belief that women can cope better with this kind of travel, their minds being more resilient to its inherent dangers. The cult has no saints of its own, though it does revere holy days that reflect its beliefs. A large proportion of the cult is made up of void born, many of whom have grow up with the Sisters in their midst. The symbol of the cult is a black disk, representing the emptiness of space. It is worth noting that the Sisters have but a single shrine. This can be found on the ''[[The Misericord|Misericord]]'' and acts as the single official meeting place for the Sisters of the Void.{{Fn|1}}

'''Slab''' is the [[Imperial]] name for a heavily processed and high-protein [[Grox]] meat, that is cheap for the Imperium to make. It also slowly degrades, which makes Slab the perfect rations for [[Astra Militarum]] [[Guardsmen]].{{Fn|1}}

'''The Sore''' is a massive [[Warp]] tunnel that was created by [[Typhus the Traveler]]'s [[Sorcerer]]s, during the [[Charadon Campaign]]. It directly connects the [[Obolis Sub-sector]]'s [[Chaos]]-held [[Alumax System]] to the [[Imperial]]-held [[Metalica System]]. Once it was created, Typhus used it to launch a direct attack on the [[Forge World]] [[Metalica]], which was his primary target for the Campaign.{{Fn|1b}} 
==Hisotry==
Its creation began, after [[Typhus]] was betrayed by the [[Sorcerer]] [[Yharron Thayl]] and the [[Dark Apostle]] [[Tsorr'Kanath]], during the [[Charadon Campaign]]. The two head been charged with attacking the [[Imperial Knights|Knights]] of [[House Raven]] in the [[Lirac Sub-sector]], to prevent them from aiding the [[Forge World]] [[Metalica]]. It was Typhus' primary target in the Campaign, but Thayl and Tsorr'Kanath ignored his orders and began their own agenda. This allowed House Raven's Knights to freely travel to the embattled [[Obolis Sub-sector]] and fall upon the invading [[Chaos]] forces. Caught by surprise, by the unexpected appearance of the Knights, Typhus' forces were beaten back by House Raven and other Imperial forces to the [[Alumax System|Alumax]] and [[Chromyd System]]s. Typhus retreated to the Alumax System{{Fn|1a}} and entered a [[psychic]] communion with the emissaries of the [[Chaos God]] [[Nurgle]], as he sought to turn the tide of the war. Critically Typhus learned from them arcane lore, that would allow him to modify the long running Chaos ritual that had begun on the Alumax System's world, [[St Bartolph's Throne]]. The ritual had originally been intended by the Traveler, to topple the last Imperial defenses barring the path to the [[Metalica System]]. Now, though, his new found knowledge allowed Typhus to create a Warp tunnel that would connect the two Systems and allow him to easily attack [[Metalica]] instead. In order to complete the ritual, however, the System's [[Monitor Station]] [[Meta-Obol Gamma 4]] would need to be captured. It was the last Imperial holdout in the Alumax System and Typhus personally led the attack upon it, to ensure it quickly fell. By then, though, the [[Space Marine]] '''Strike Force Scourge''', led by the [[Excruciators (Chapter)|Excruciators]]' [[Chapter Master]] [[Dhane Tanielu]], had entered the [[System]] and sought to stop Typhus' plans. Tanielu had first intended to press the Imperium's advantage by invading the Alumax System, but shortly after their arrival, his [[Chief Librarian]], [[Mosu Ioanu]], was struck with dire visions. While he did not know exactly what Typhus planned, Ionau knew it would be catastrophic for the Imperium and it involved St Bartolph's Throne and Meta-Obol Gamma 4. The Chief Librarian shared his visions with Tanielu and the Chapter Master ordered the Strike Force to split into two parts. He would lead an attack on the [[Chaos]] ritual site, they had discovered on St Bartolph's Throne, while the other half of the Strike Force would defend Meta-Obol Gamma 4, from Typhus.{{Fn|1b}} 

Despite their fierce efforts, however, the Strike Force defending Meta-Obol Gamma 4 was slain and [[Typhus]] claimed the [[Monitor Station]]. He then planted several [[Malignifier]]s that were swelled with the power of [[Chaos]], aboard the Meta-Obol Gamma 4. Once the final one was implanted, the Magnifiers across the [[Charadon Sector]] entered into a [[psychic]] link with each other. This empowered the [[Chaos]] ritual on [[St Bartolph's Throne]] and allowed it to be completed, even as the [[Sorcerer]]s were being attacked by the Strike Force led by [[Chapter Master]] [[Dhane Tanielu]]. As the world began to collapse in on itself, Tanielu gave the order to retreat to their ships, though, many of the Strike Force's [[Space Marines]], were not able to escape in time. Soon St Bartolph's Throne was consumed by the ritual, which had created a giant [[Warp Rift]] which emitted the power of [[Nurgle]] from its entrance. The Strike Force did not realize it, at the time, but another Warp Rift had also opened within the [[Metalica System]] and each was connected to each other. Typhus knew his plan had succeeded, though, and led his [[Plague Fleet]] into the Warp tunnel and soon fell upon the surprised Metalica System{{Fn|1b}}. The Warp tunnel as been named '''The Sore''' by the System's embattled Imperial defenders and it is also aiding Typhus' forces in the attack. The power of Nurgle flows through its opening in flares containing [[Daemons]], which corrupt everything they hit. The Metalica System [[Hive World]] [[Munis Ferrum]], lies close to The Sore and has been repeatedly bombarded by these plague flares. As a result, the world is becoming a decaying nightmare and is now being swarmed by Daemons of Nurgle. Gigantic tentacles have also emerged from the Warp tunnel, and they attacking anything they can reach. Like the flares, the tentacles bring corruption to anything they touch and also cause Daemons to appear. This proved the doom of the [[Metalica]] [[Gun Barge]] [[Proximedes-Cerrus]], as it began to decay after being caught by the tentacles. Even as it fired upon its captors, the Cerrus' crew was overwhelmed by a tide of [[Daemon]]s that were summoned by the tentacles. The Sore has also disrupted local Warp currents, which has delayed or prevented [[Imperial]] reinforcements from aiding the embattled [[System]]. Worse still, The Sore is expanding at a staggering rate and no ones knows how large it will grow. Some Imperials fear, that it may even shallow the Metalica System whole.{{Fn|1c}}

The '''Adeptus Astartes''' (commonly known as '''Space Marines''', and colloquially as '''Angels of Death''') are one of the most elite and feared fighting forces in the [[Imperium of Man]]. The primary unit of organisation is the [[Chapter]], a self-contained army fully equipped with its own transport, non-combatant support staff, etc. There are around a thousand Chapters, each comprising a thousand Space Marines. There are far too few Space Marines to form the Imperium's main military forces; instead they operate as highly mobile strike forces. They are entrusted with the most dangerous missions, such as lightning raids behind enemy lines, infiltration, and tunnel fighting{{Fn|5}}. Through selection, training, and conditioning, Marines are physically, mentally, and spiritually superior to any other Imperial soldier.{{Fn|4}}
[[Image:Adeptus Astartes.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of the Adeptus Astartes{{Fn|19}}]]

==History==
[[Image:SM6.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Space Marines battle the forces of [[Chaos]]{{Fn|9}}]]
*{{Main|Thunder Warriors}}
Originating from the [[Thunder Warriors]], the first Space Marines were created from the genetic material of the [[Primarch]]s after they were spirited away from the [[Emperor of Mankind|Emperor]] by the [[Gods of Chaos]] in the aftermath of the [[Unification Wars]]. Twenty [[Space Marine Legion|Legions of Space Marines]] were created, each from the genetic material of a specific Primarch. The first Astartes were created only by the massive effort of the [[Emperor]] and countless [[Terra]]n scientists of [[Amar Astarte]]'s [[Biotechnical Division]]{{Fn|24}} who worked deep within the Himalazia  Mountains. The original Astartes gene-seed was unstable and caused its subjects to degrade rapidly, but once it was stabilized by samples provided by newly rediscovered Primarchs, long-term stability was achieved.{{Fn|13}}

The Legions took part in the [[Great Crusade]], during which the lost Primarchs were rediscovered and given command of their respective Legion. The Crusade, lasting for two centuries, ended with the treachery of one of the Primarchs, [[Horus]], who led at least half of the Legions in a rebellion known as the [[Horus Heresy]] against the Emperor. In the final battle for control of the future of mankind, Horus was slain by the Emperor. With the rebellion defeated, those Legions which had sided with Horus were driven into the [[Eye of Terror]].

The Legions which had remained loyal were eventually reorganised according to the dictates of the [[Codex Astartes]], in the event known as the [[Second Founding]]. Each Legion was divided into several autonomous Chapters, which remain the primary unit of the Space Marines to the current day.

Successive [[founding]]s over the millennia have created new Chapters. There are now around a thousand Chapters in existence, each Chapter ultimately descending from one of the loyalist Legions. Later in the closing days of the [[41st Millennium]] the resurrected [[Roboute Guilliman]] and his [[Mechanicum]] researchers oversaw the creation of a new generation of Astartes, known as the [[Primaris Space Marine]].

To some extent, the Chapters maintain the traditions and character of the Legion they descend from. Chapters adhere to the Codex Astartes in differing degrees, some regarding any deviation from it as virtual heresy; others, notably the [[Black Templars]], [[Blood Angels]], [[Space Wolves]], and [[Dark Angels]], only following the Codex in the broadest matters.{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|3b}}{{Fn|5}}

==Organisation==
[[Image:UMArt7.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[Firstborn]] Space Marine of the [[Ultramarines]] ]]
*{{Main|Chapter}}
The Adeptus Astartes is comprised of autonomous [[Chapter]]s, each of which is a complete army in itself, possessing its own transport, [[Warp]]-capable spacecraft, non-combatant personnel, and [[fortress-monastery]] based on a planet or fleet. There are roughly a thousand Chapters, each led by a Space Marine with the rank of [[Chapter Master]]. A Chapter's fighting force numbers a nominal 1000 Marines, divided into ten companies, each of which is commanded by a [[Captain]]. Companies are further divided into squads of ten battle-brothers, each commanded by a [[Space Marine Sergeant|Sergeant]].{{Fn|4}}

The Chapter Masters owe their allegiance to the Emperor. Ultimately, the Chapter is subject to the orders of the highest-ranking among the [[Adeptus Terra]], although only in a general sense.{{Fn|6}}

Chapters are monastic communities in nature; for most of the Marines, the Chapter is their world, and the only contact they have with outsiders is in battle.

===Tactical Organisation===
*{{Main|Codex Astartes}}
[[Image:SMHeraldry.jpg|thumb|right|Space Marine heraldry as per the [[Codex Astartes]] ]]
The traditional Codex Chapter is tactically organised into a number of different types of squad: [[Battleline Squad]]s consist of either [[Tactical Squad]]s or [[Primaris Space Marine|Primaris]] [[Intercessor Squad]]s. [[Close Support Squad]]s consist of either [[Assault Squad]]s, [[Inceptor Squad]]s, or [[Reiver Squad]]s. [[Fire Support Squad]]s consist of [[Devastator Squad]]s, [[Desolation Squad]]s, [[Hellblaster Squad]]s, [[Eradicator Squad]]s, or {{Fn|29}} [[Aggressor Squad]]s. The squad types are equipped and trained to fulfill a specific battlefield role, each of the three types designed to complement each other on the battlefield to make a far more effective whole. In addition to these three squad types, veterans can be formed into [[Veteran Squad (Space Marines)|Veteran]] or [[Terminator Squad]]s, while the initiate Marines are formed into [[Space Marine Scout|Scout]] squads.

Terminator squads are drawn from the entire chapter's best and most experienced warriors. The veterans wear the uniquely powerful [[Terminator Armour]]. These squads are formed when circumstances necessitate the concentration of the Chapter's most capable warriors and potent equipment into one or more heavily-armed and powerful units.{{Fn|7}}

====Ranks====
All Space Marine Chapters loosely utilize the same types of ranks. Many non-[[Codex Astartes]] chapters, however, will often use different names for these positions.{{Fn|14b}}
*[[Chapter Master]] â€” The highest attainable rank of Space Marine, commanding their entire Chapter.{{Fn|14b}} Notable variations include [[Dark Angels Supreme Grand Master|Supreme Grand Master]] for the [[Unforgiven]], [[Great Khan]] for the [[White Scars]], [[High Marshal (Black Templars)|High Marshal]] for the [[Black Templars]], [[Master of the Shadows]] for the [[Raven Guard]], and [[Great Wolf]] for the [[Space Wolves]]. Some Chapters, like the [[Iron Hands]], do not maintain a Chapter Master.{{Fn|15}}
*[[Space Marine Captain|Captain]] â€” The second highest rank of a Chapter, they command a [[Space Marine Company|Company]] or its equivalent. Variations include [[Dark Angels Grand Master|Master]] for the [[Dark Angels]], [[Marshal (Black Templars)|Marshal]] for the [[Black Templars]], [[Wolf Lord]] for the [[Space Wolves]], [[Iron Captain]] for the [[Iron Hands]], and [[Khan]] for the [[White Scars]]. Many Captains are given an honorific [[Space Marine Master|Master]] title.{{Fn|14b}}
*[[Space Marine Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] â€” These serve as the right hand to their Company Captain, typically commanding one of the Company's two demi-companies.{{Fn|18}}
*[[Space Marine Sergeant|Sergeant]] â€” Command Squads within each Company. Sergeants within the Chapter's 1st Company are known as [[Veteran Sergeant]]s.{{Fn|14b}}
*[[Battle-Brother]] â€” Standard Space Marine rank for a fully inducted warrior. May include honorific duties such as [[Space Marine Honour Guard|Honour Guard]], [[Company Champion]], or [[Company Standard Bearer|Standard Bearer]]. The most experienced Battle-Brothers serve in the Chapter's 1st Company as [[Veteran Space Marine]]s, who may wear ancient [[Terminator]] armor.{{Fn|14b}} 
*[[Vanguard Space Marine]] - Covert-operation experts typically drawn from the 10th [[Scout]] Company. A Chapter will normally maintain 100 of these specialists.
*[[Neophyte]] â€” Space Marines in-training who have not become fully accepted Battle-Brothers. They are utilized in a Chapter's [[Scout]] Squads as a part of their training.{{Fn|3a}}
*[[Aspirant]] â€” [[Human]]s selected to be inducted into a Chapter and undergo genetic modification.{{Fn|4}}
[[Image:SMChapterOrgNew.jpg|thumb|right|Organization of a Space Marine [[Chapter]] since the introduction of [[Primaris Space Marine]]s{{Fn|20}}]]

====Specialist Ranks====
In addition to their standard ranks, Space Marine Chapters also maintain a variety of specialist roles.{{Fn|14a}}
*[[Librarian]] â€” [[Psyker]] warriors of the Chapter.{{Fn|14a}} Variations include [[Rune Priest]] for the [[Space Wolves]] and [[Stormseer]] for the [[White Scars]]. Some Chapters, such as the [[Black Templars]], do not use Librarians.{{Fn|16}}
**[[Chief Librarian]] â€” The senior most Librarian of a Chapter and the commander of its [[Librarium]].
**[[Codicier]] â€” The 2nd highest rank of Librarian
**[[Epistolary]] â€” The 3rd highest rank of Librarian
**[[Lexicanium]] â€” The rank of newly-inducted Librarians
**'''Acolytum''' â€” Librarians in training, not yet inducted into the Librarium.{{Fn|14a}}
*[[Chaplain]] â€” Warrior-Priests of a Chapter who oversee morale, discipline, and spiritual purity.{{Fn|14b}} Variations include [[Wolf Priest]]s of the [[Space Wolves]] and [[Interrogator-Chaplain]]s of the [[Unforgiven]].
**[[Master of Sanctity]] â€” The senior most Chaplain of a Chapter and commander of its [[Reclusium]].
**[[Reclusiarch]] â€” Senior Chaplains
**'''Chaplain''' â€” Standard Rank{{Fn|14a}}
*[[Apothecary]] â€” Battlefield medical specialists charged with not only healing their comrades, but also collecting the [[Gene-Seed]] of fallen warriors.{{Fn|14b}} Variations include the [[Sanguinary Priest]]s of the [[Blood Angels]] and their [[Successor Chapter]]s.
**[[Master of the Apothecarion]] â€” Senior most Apothecary and commander of their Chapter's [[Apothecarion]].{{Fn|14a}}
**'''Apothecary''' â€” Standard Rank{{Fn|14a}}
*[[Techmarine]] â€” Technology officers and engineers of a Chapter who maintain the [[Armoury]].{{Fn|14b}} Variations include [[Iron Father]] for the [[Iron Hands]] and [[Iron Priest]]s for the [[Space Wolves]].
**[[Master of the Forge]] â€” Most senior rank who commands the Chapter Armoury.{{Fn|14a}}
**'''Techmarine''' â€” Standard Rank{{Fn|14a}}
*[[Master of the Signal]] â€” Battlefield communications specialists.
*[[Chapter Ancient]] â€” Revered Standard-bearer
*[[Judiciar]] - Executioner who works under the [[Chapter Master]]{{Fn|28}}

===Chapter cult===
A Chapter cult is an integral aspect of a Space Marine Chapter. Every Space Marine belongs to the Chapter's cult, and accordingly, every Marine of a Chapter is a spiritual brother as well as a brother in arms. These warrior cults emphasise honour, comradeship, and strength. Chapter cults, often thousands of years old, have each developed their own distinct traditions and in many cases these cults pre-date the [[Imperial Cult]], the official religion of the Imperium. Each Space Marine cult is unique and autonomous, ministered by an inner priesthood of warriors known as [[Chaplain]]s. The practices of Space Marine cults, rumored to be barbaric and bloody, serve to make Space Marines all the more feared by the mass of humanity.

==Equipment==
[[Image:SMActivity8th.jpg|thumb|right|Space Marine deployments.|300px]]
*{{main|Space Marine Armoury}}
The primary individual weapons of the Space Marines is the [[boltgun]] and its pistol variant, the [[bolt pistol]].

The distinctive [[Power Armour]] is worn by all Marines in battle. Some members of the Chapter's first company may instead be armoured in the heavier [[Terminator Armour]]. [[Carapace armour]] is worn by [[Space Marine Scout|Scout]]s instead of power armour. There is also a fourth type of armour called [[Artificer armour]], worn by most Marines who have served three centuries for the Emperor or performed a notably brave action in battle.

Each Space Marines Chapters has its own distinguished color scheme. Unlike the [[Astra Militarum]], Space Marines do not typically use camouflage because Adeptus Astartes combat doctrine does not follow the tactics of concealment in battles. Bright and bold color schemes lower enemy morale, announcing the arriving of the noble Chapter to the battlefield. The exceptions to the main colors may still exist for some of the Chapter's Companies - for example [[Deathwing]] company of the [[Dark Angels]] Chapter use white color scheme and the [[Raven wing]] â€” black.{{Fn|17}}

In the same time Chapter's vehicles may be painted in different colors until the large bands of areas painted in the Chapter colors.{{Fn|17}}

==Recruitment and Training==
{{main|Creation of a Space Marine}}

Recruits are chosen from the best warriors among [[human]]ity. Naturally, this makes [[Feral World]]s prized recruitment grounds, as such harsh and primal conditions produce the best warriors. However, [[Hive World]]s are considered the ideal source of potential recruits, the populace of the lower levels composed of some of the most murderous scum in the human Imperium. Whole gangs of hive scum are sometimes hunted down and captured for recruitment. Among the most valued traits in a recruit are aggression and psychotic-level killer instinct. Much more rarely, certain [[Civilised World]]s are also recruited from.{{Fn|4}}{{Fn|6}}

The potential recruit is first subjected to testing, including tissue compatibility tests and psychological screening. Relatively few get past this initial selection process. Those that do pass are termed &quot;neophytes&quot;, and the process continues with the surgery, indoctrination, conditioning, and training that will make them Marines.

The surgical process takes a great deal of time. The recruit receives implants, along with chemical- and hypnotherapy, and training necessary for allowing the functioning and development of the implanted organs. The implants transform their bodies and minds and give them inhuman abilities - making them capable of spitting acidic venom, absorbing the memories of the dead by eating their flesh, darkening their skin to protect it from radiation, and operating for long periods without sleep by switching off parts of their brains at a time. After this implantation process and the associated training, the recruit becomes an &quot;initiate&quot;.

Intense indoctrination and conditioning strengthens the recruit's resolve and increases mental capabilities, honing them into dedicated and merciless warriors. After more general training, they join the Chapter as full &quot;brothers&quot;.{{Fn|2}}

==Daily Routine==
{{main|Daily rituals of a Space Marine}}
Space Marines have very organised daily routines including combat training, prayer, and indoctrination sessions with very little free time. This lends itself well to the disciplined and monastic nature of the Space Marines.

==Primaris Space Marine==
[[Image:Mk10power armor.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A Primaris Space Marine of the [[Ultramarines]] Chapter{{Fn|22}}]]
{{main|Primaris Space Marines}}
In the closing days of the [[41st Millennium]] the Imperium was able to field a new generation of Space Marine thanks to the efforts of [[Roboute Guilliman]] and [[Belisarius Cawl]]. Known as the Primaris Space Marine, they have been distributed among the many loyalist Chapters. Since the introduction of Primaris Space Marines, the original template Space Marines are referred to as '''[[Firstborn]]'''.{{Fn|21}}

'''Spiders''' are arachnids found on [[Terra]], but the name is now applied by [[Humans]] to any creatures that are descended from or in anyway resemble them.{{Fn|1}}

This is because Spiders can now be found on every world that Mankind has made its domain. There are several theories as to how this happened, with some speculating that arachnids accidentally stowed away on the first Terran ships that were sent to colonize distant worlds. Other theories include that they were deliberately introduced on worlds as pest control against the native insects, while some speculate that perhaps spiders are just a naturally occurring species.{{Fn|1}}

Regardless, spiders have become meaningful to many [[Imperium]] worlds, such as [[Necromunda (planet)|Necronmunda]] where they feature heavily in the heraldry of many clans and ruling families: none moreso than [[House Van Saar]], which captures or breeds large spiders that it then modifies into [[Servitor]]s called [[Cyberachnid]]s.{{Fn|1}}

'''Stalkerhounds''' are a tall and lean breed of [[Dog]], that has a strong senses of smell.{{Fn|1}}
==Description==
The breed is owned by some [[Imperial Knight]] [[Noble]]s on [[Dominion (Knight World)|Dominion]], where they act as hunting [[Dog]]s which flush out prey for their masters to shoot. In this capacity, a Noble will own a pack of Stalkerhounds, who view their owner as their packmaster. During these hunts in Dominon's wilds, however, there is a chance that some will not back down when commanded to, after confronting dangerous creatures such as [[Ursid]]s. This will then likely result in the Stalkerhound's death at the prey's hands. Also, disguised [[Callidus]] must be cautious around the breed if the [[Assassin]]s are masquerading as someone the Stalkerhounds are familiar with. Some have such a strong sense of smell, that they can sense the Callidus smells differently than the person the Assassin is disguised as. This can then cause the Stalkerhounds to begin growling at the Callidus.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Star Child''' is a mysterious entity said to represent the soul of the [[Emperor of Mankind]]. It is also known as the '''Numen'''{{Fn|4}}, and the '''Chaos Child'''.{{Cite this}}

== History ==
Over the millennia since the [[Emperor]]'s internment upon the [[Golden Throne]], the link between his body and soul has become increasingly tenuous. As the Emperor's spirit drifts through the [[warp]], much of its energies have been dissolved, except for a tiny core that remained whole. So long as this portion of the Emperor's soul survived, there remained hope for humanity, for just as the [[New Man]] was born of the collective souls of the [[Shamans]], so too may the Emperor's soul be reborn one day. This potential was merely a child awaiting birth, the '''Star Child'''. The Star Child also represents the human portion of the [[warp]].{{Fn|2a}}

The Star Child is also suggested (by a fragment of the Emperor's mind) as being the compassion which the Emperor cast from himself in order to destroy his most beloved [[Primarch]]-son, [[Horus]].{{Fn|3b}} [[Inquisitor]] [[Jaq Draco]] believed that '''Shining Path''' upon which the Numen may be born originates within a special node of the [[Webway]], known as [[Uigebealach]], where time flows backwards. He believed that by visiting this special crossroads, and achieving a triumph by resurrecting a lost soul, he may accelerate the birth of the Numen.{{Fn|5c}}. However, upon his death, he had instead achieved [[Apotheosis]], becoming a tiny part of the Numen as a diffuse hydrogen atom in the void will one day condense into a star.{{Fn|5d}}

== The Star Child and the Sensei ==
The [[Sensei]] are the immortal, true sons of the [[Emperor]], sired during his early life amongst humanity. Whereas the [[Chaos Gods]] possess their own [[Champion of Chaos|champions]], the [[Sensei]] act as the champions of the Star Child.{{Fn|2b}} Likewise, just as a [[Champion of Chaos]] may be blessed by the gifts of one or more [[Chaos Gods]], the Star Child gifts the Sensei with the [[Mark of the Star Child]], which allows them to draw upon the energy of the Star Child.{{Fn|2c}}

The powers can range from extra protection, [[daemon]]-slaying abilities, sword mastery, and marksmanship amongst other gifts. These gifts may likewise permeate other members of a Sensei's adventurer band.{{Fn|2d}} When the Star Child recognizes the deeds of a Sensei, they will be drawn into the warp to commune with the Star Child, where he may achieve [[Apotheosis]] and become a [[Sensei Master]], which is analogous to a [[Daemon Prince]].{{Fn|2d}}

In 997.[[M41]], [[Inquisitor]] [[Fortez]] reported that he and his colleagues [[Alexio]] and [[Credo (Inquisitor)|Credo]] had discovered a cult known as the [[Cult of the Star Child]], led by self-proclaimed [[Sensei]] claiming to be the Emperor's sons. However, Inquisitor Fortez rejected the notion that they are the Emperor's sons on the basis of their affiliation with [[abhumans]] and [[Eldar]]. The Inquisitor instead suspected it may be a [[Tzeentch|Tzeentchian]] cult, with the Architect of Fate masquerading as the Star Child. The cult and all but four Sensei were killed.{{Fn|6}}

== The Star Child and the Illuminati ==
The [[Illuminati]] await the birth of the Star Child and the second coming of the [[New Man]]{{Fn|2a}} in the form of the [[Sensei-Emperor]].{{Fn|1}} The Illuminati gather the [[Sensei]], to establish a [[Long Watch]] of [[Sensei Knights]] to await the final battle against the forces of [[Chaos]].{{Fn|1}}{{Fn|4}} However, this is merely a trick, as the Illuminati instead seeks to sacrifice the Sensei to the Emperor at the moment of his death, just as countless [[psykers]] are sacrificed to the Emperor. When this occurs, the Illuminati believe the [[Sensei-Emperor]], the second coming of the [[New Man]] will arise.{{Fn|1}}

One legend states that once the Emperor dies, his soul will be freed to go into the warp.  Here it will neutralize the Chaos Gods, causing the physical universe to fight one last bloody conflict against itself for the control of the galaxy.{{Fn|8}}

==Psychic Awakening==
Due to the [[Psychic Awakening]], the legend of the Star Child seems to have been rekindled. A few years into the [[Indomitus Crusade]], visions of a golden infant interspersed with flashes of a radiant being rising from a throne of light began to be reported across [[Astropath]]ic relay networks, beginning in [[Segmentum Solar]]. Over time the images became clearer, and many began to interpret this with the legend of the Star Child. These visions caused great upheaval in the Imperium, leading many to investigate the truth of the matter. Others, including servants of [[Chaos]] such as [[Kor Phaeron]] and [[Tenebrus]], seek to stop the awakening of the Star Child.{{Fn|9}}

The Black Templars Initiate also received a vision while battling at the Atillan Gate. It was of a burning Throne, wreathed in chains. Eight terrible shadows, their long skeletal hands reaching out to crush the holy light of the God-Emperor. Golden eyes opening in the face of a child, filled with ancient knowledge.{{Fn|10}}

The '''Static Tendency''' are a group of [[Imperial]] officials in the [[Imperial Palace]], who resist any efforts to change the Imperium's constitution.{{Fn|1}} 

They viewed it to be perfect, by a clear understanding of historical law and theology, and any attempt to fundamentally change the constitution, amounted to treason against the [[Emperor]] Himself. When the reborn [[Primarch]] [[Guilliman]] returned to Terra, he began efforts to weaken the Static Tendency; as he realized they would stand in the way of the changes he sought to make to the [[Imperium]]. Chief amongst these efforts, was the removal of any [[High Lords]] that were part of the Static Tendency, which included [[Irthu Haemotalion]] and [[Baldo Slyst]]. However he allowed the Static sympathizers [[Aveliza Drachmar]] and [[Fadix]] to remain as High Lords. In doing so, Guilliman tried to maintain a difficult balancing act, between the various Imperial factions he now had to contend with.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Stellarum Vigil''' was during the [[Horus Heresy]] one of the tallest structures of the [[Imperial Palace]] of the [[Emperor]]. When standing on its ramparts, it is impossible for a unaugmented human to breathe without a [[rebreather]].{{Fn|1}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an agency of the [[Imperium]]. Its leader, the '''Lord Constable''', is a lesser member of the [[Senatorum Imperialis]].{{Fn|1}}

===Purpose===
The term synopticon refers to the surveillance of the few by the many, likely indicating that this organization acts as a surveillance and [[Wikipedia: Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] agency for the Imperium.

The '''Time of Ending''' refers to the last centuries of the [[41st Millennium]].{{Fn|1b}} It began c.750.[[M41]], following the [[Imperium]]'s first encounter with the extragalactic [[Tyranid]] threat.{{Fn|2}}

Ultimately, the Time of Ending was followed by the [[Age of the Dark Imperium]].{{Fn|13}}

==Overview==
The term was first coined in 744.M41, by [[Taggarath]], the Seer of Corrinto, who predicted a time of upheaval in which both the Imperium and the Light of the Emperor would be swallowed by an approaching darkness.  He was eventually executed for heresy.{{Fn|1b}}

The Tyranids, as well as other threats such as the [[Necrons]] which rose in the subsequent years, made it apparent that the galaxy was turning into an even more dangerous place, challenging the millennia-old belief of the Imperium's perpetuity.{{Fn|2}}

The Time of Ending is also a time in which young, upstart alien races are able to establish their own fledging realms in the galaxy.  The [[Draxian Hegemony]], the [[Tau Empire]], the [[Worldweave of Noisome Reek]], the [[UlumÃ©athic League]] and numerous others have prospered, ready to stand their ground against the besieged Imperium of Man.{{Fn|1a}}

==Notable Events==
* 745.M41: [[Hive Fleet Behemoth]] arrives in the galaxy.  The [[First Tyrannic War]].
* 897.M41: First contact with the [[Necrons]]{{Fn|3}}
* 990.M41: [[Hive Fleet Kraken]] arrives in the galaxy.  [[Second Tyrannic War]].{{Fn|4}}
* 997.M41 onwards: [[Hive Fleet Leviathan]] arrives in the galaxy.  The [[Third Tyrannic War]].{{Fn|4}}
* 998.M41 onwards: The [[3rd War for Armageddon]]
* 999.M41: As the light of the [[Astronomican]] grows dimmer, [[Techpriest]]s discover irreparable failures in the [[Golden Throne]]{{Fn|1b}}. Desperate, the Tech-Priests and [[Radical]] [[Inquisitor]]s journey into the [[Webway]] and strike a dark bargain with [[Commorragh]].{{Fn|6}}
*999.[[M41]]: The [[Hunt for the Wulfen|Wulfen Return]] and [[Siege of the Fenris System|Fenris is besieged]]. [[Magnus]] returns and The [[Planet of the Sorcerers]] is moved over [[Prospero]].{{Fn|7}}
*999.[[M41]]: The [[Ynnari]] form to resurrect [[Ynnead]] and destroy [[Slaanesh]]. [[Biel-Tan]] is devastated by the birth of [[Yncarne]] and a [[Daemonic]] invasion while [[Commorragh]] is besieged by a great [[Dysjunction]].{{Fn|9}}
* 999.M41 onwards: The [[13th Black Crusade]]'s encroachment on [[Terra]] and the rumored return of the [[Daemon Primarch]]s at the helm of Chaos forces.{{Fn|5}} Cadia is eventually destroyed by Abaddon.{{Fn|8}} 
*The [[Ultramar Campaign]] and [[Terran Crusade]] see the Primarch [[Roboute Guilliman]] resurrected as he takes commander of the Imperium once more. This action attracts the gaze of the [[Chaos Gods]], and the entire Warp is thrown into a turmoil on a level unseen since the [[Age of Strife]], creating the [[Great Rift]].{{Fn|10}}

The formation of the Great Rift marks the beginning of the '''[[Age of the Dark Imperium]]'''.{{Fn|13}}

'''Torchbearers''' are specialized task forces that, in the wake of the [[Great Rift]]'s creation, were tasked to make contact with specific Space Marine Chapters and give them the ability to create their own Primaris battle-brothers.{{Fn|1}} 

==Overview==
Torchbearers were first created early during the muster of the [[Indomitus Crusade]] on [[Terra]] and were typically comprised of small, fast, heavily armed craft, garrisoned with a mixture of [[Silent Sisters]], [[Emissaries Imperatus]] [[Adeptus Custodes|Custodes]], and [[Greyshield]] [[Primaris]] of the Chapter to be reinforced. These escorts ensured that their precious cargo reached its destination regardless of threats and impediments and was put swiftly to use by its recipients. Many Torchbearer task forces were assigned to Chapters located in distant locations from Terra, were within the [[Dark Imperium]] or else too mobile in nature, for the main thrust of the Indomitus Crusade Fleets to reach. Torchbearers assigned to these Chapters employed every asset that might lend them speed and efficacy. These included, multiple cadres of Silent Sisters, whose presence quelled the most ferocious of [[Warp Storm]]s and aided the task forces in weathering an often-desperate passage to the Dark Imperium, through the madness of the
[[Great Rift]]. Some further augmented their ranks with [[Rogue Traders]], whose ships and knowledge of hidden routes were invaluable, as well as potent [[Astropath]]s, to aid in making contact with their quarry, and [[Brotherhood (Grey Knights)|Brotherhood]]s of [[Grey Knights]] to
stave off attacks by [[Daemon]].{{Fn|1}} 

Other Torchbearers were assigned to reach [[Chapter]]s that were known to be nearing extinction. These task forces were then charged with determining if the Chapters still existed and if they did, then the Torchbearers were to begin replenishing their depleted strength. If, however, the Chapter had been destroyed, then it was to be reestablished from amongst the task force's [[Greyshield]]s, and then charged with exacting vengeance upon whatever foe had destroyed their original forebears. Some Torchbearers, though, were assigned to Chapters who, for reasons of doctrine, genetic heritage, or historical circumstance, were expected to resist the gift of the [[Primaris Space Marine|Primaris]]. In such cases these task forces' garrisons of [[Adeptus Custodes]] was typically larger than average, to leave no doubt that they delivered a boon graced by the [[Emperor]] himself.{{Fn|1}}

A known battle of the Torchbearers is the [[War of the Spider]].{{Fn|2}}

The '''Tower of Heroes''' is a black tower located in the [[Imperial Palace]] of the [[Emperor]] that rises high into the sky like a spike. At its summit resides the [[Bell of Lost Souls]] that is tolled whenever a great hero of the [[Imperium]] has fallen.{{Fn|1}}

The '''Trackless Chain''' is one of the largest and most secretive [[Imperial]] [[Cold Trade|Silent Trader]] [[Criminal Cartel]]s, that is active in the [[Macharian Sector]].{{Fn|1}}
==Description==
They control the bulk of selling [[Xenos]] weapons and artefacts in the [[Macharian Sector|Sector]] and are also bold enough to launch ambushes on species to replenish their stocks. Even the [[Drukhari]] have been attacked by the Trackless Chains' forces, as the [[Cartel]] seeks to obtain &quot;fresh&quot; merchandise to sell to its clients.{{Fn|1}}

[[File:Galaxy map Trail of Saint Evisser.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Approximate location of the Trail of Saint Evisser]]
{{Spoiler|source=Grey Knights (Novel)}}
The '''Trail of Saint Evisser''' a collection of systems located on the far western edge of the [[Segmentum Solar]], visited in pilgrimage by [[Kelkannis Evisser]], an obscure [[Administratum]] officer who mysteriously turned into an [[Imperial Saint]].

This tract of frontier space is so named because of the unwavering faith that the saint brought to the collection of worlds that he visited. During his travels, the saint moved from world to world working miracles in the name of the [[Emperor]]. As the saint grew in fame, more people flocked to the planets he had visited in hopes of seeing him. These pilgrims brought much-needed prosperity with them and, in thanks, the powerful and wealthy constructed shrines and chapels bearing the name of Saint Evisser.{{Fn|1}}

As the [[Imperium]] grew, shipping lanes began to bypass the trail and the former prosperity slipped away causing widespread poverty. The nobles of the Trail, who had so lavishly decorated all of the worlds, moved on, leaving the lower classes to continue their toil in the Emperor's name. As the centuries passed the trail fell further and further into decay.{{Cite This}}

==Notable Events==
Most notably, the trail was the site of the attempted re-manifestation of the [[daemon]] [[Ghargatuloth]], also known as The Prince of a Thousand Faces. This re-manifestation led to the rise of anarchists throughout the Trail in order to confuse Imperial forces attempting to defeat the daemon. Most notable of the Imperial retaliation was a strike force of [[Grey Knights]] led by [[Justicar]] [[Alaric]].{{Fn|1}}

==Notable Planets==
The '''Trail of Saint Evisser''' contains the following planets{{Fn|1}}:
*[[Trepytos]]
*[[Magnos Omicron]]
*[[Farfallen]]
*[[Victrix Sonora]]
*[[Sophano Secundus]]
*[[Solshen XIX]]
*[[Volcanis Ultor]]

The '''Treaty of Olympus''' was a diplomatic agreement between the [[Imperium of Man]] and the [[Adeptus Mechanicus|Martian Mechanicum]] binding the former to the latter in 739.[[M30]]{{Fn|2}}. 

The Treaty was signed shortly after the [[Emperor]] landed on Mars at the dawn of the [[Great Crusade]], calling for unity and displaying seemingly supernatural powers over machinery, repairing a [[Knight]] instantly with a mere touch.{{Fn|1}} Many on Mars began to consider the Emperor the [[Omnissiah]] incarnate. As part of the stipulations of the treaty, the [[Emperor]] agreed to not interfere in the internal structure of the Mechanicum and allowed them to continue their beliefs in the [[Omnissiah]], the avatar of the Machine God.  In exchange, the Cult of the Machine produced and manufactured the wide amount of weapon, ships and other tools for the Imperium for the [[Great Crusade]].{{Fn|1}}

Many members of the Martian Mechanicum, including [[Fabricator-General]] [[Kelbor-Hal]], resented the Treaty of Olympus and saw it as a means for the Emperor to subordinate Martian forges. This tension eventually led to the [[Schism of Mars]] during the [[Horus Heresy]].{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:RaptorImperialis.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor's symbol during Unification, the [[Raptor Imperialis]] ]]
The '''Unification Wars''', also known as the '''Wars of Unification''', is the name of an ancient number of conflicts fought at the end of the [[Age of Strife]].  They were spearheaded by the warlord known only as [[The Emperor]] in his attempt at reunifying the shattered tribes and nations of [[Terra]], now ruled largely by [[Techno-Barbarian]] lords.  His intentions were to reforge the shattered remnants of Man and create an [[Imperium]] that would bring about a [[Great Crusade]] to bring order to the galaxy.

==Overview==
===Prelude===
By [[M29]], [[Terra]] had been engulfed in the chaos and anarchy of the [[Age of Strife]] for several thousand years. Terra was a violent cauldron divided between city-states, Techno-Barbarian warlords, and various other polities. However as [[Slaanesh]] was close to its birth at the epicenter of the [[Eldar Empire]], the [[Warp Storm]]s plaguing humanity's homeworld becalmed themselves. Sensing the time was right, a being known as [[The Emperor]] finally began his campaign to reclaim Earth.{{Fn|11}}

Appearing openly for the first time, The Emperor led his [[Thunder Warriors]], genetically engineered super soldiers created in secret laboratories{{Fn|6}}, in a series of campaigns against all other warlords and [[Techno-barbarian]]s of Old Earth. His forces included not only the Thunder Warriors but also the [[Custodian Guard]], formations that would become the early [[Imperial Army]] including [[Geno Five-Two Chiliad]] and the [[Inferallti Hussars]], and eventually the proto-[[Astartes]]. His forces utilized the advanced weapons of the [[Terrawatt Clan]] after he secured an alliance with them.{{Fn|8}} Thus did the Emperor make his move on the major powers of Terra.{{Fn|8}} One of his earliest major campaigns was against the [[Maulland Sen Confederacy]].{{Fn|19a}}

===Subduing Terra===
*[[Albia]] -  Albians refused to kneel before the Emperor and met his Thunder Warriors with their own proto-dreadnoughts and armored ironside soldiers. In battle after battle, the Albians managed to hold back the Emperor's forces but only at staggering cost for the defenders. Admitting the martial temper and indomitable spirit of his foe, the Emperor called a ceasefire and sought a diplomatic solution. The Emperor appeared before the Albian Clan Lords unarmed and clothed in white and crimson, speaking of his vision of a unified mankind. He offered them glory among the stars and redemption. To the shock of many, the warlords of Albia, seeing the Emperor as different from past tyrants, accepted terms and soon became one of the most zealous supporters of unification.{{Fn|10b}}

*[[Albyon]] -  the tyrannical warlord [[Uilleam the Red]] is defeated by the Emperor's forces and imprisoned in the dungeon of [[Khangba Marwu]]{{Fn|9a}}

*[[Achaemenid Empire]] - Swearing allegiance to the Emperor early on in his war, the Achaemenid Empire suffered little during the Wars of Unification, avoiding both atomic strike and invasion by Thunder Warriors.{{Fn|3}}

*[[Great King of Akkad|Akkad]] - Fought against the forces of the [[Emperor]] in Central Asia alongside his [[Udug Hul]] elite. They were ultimately defeated by the [[First Legion]]{{Fn|20}}

*[[Atlan]] - '''Ur-queen''' of this country was killed by [[Adeptus Custodes]] during one of the battles{{Fn|16}}

*[[Boeotia]] - Mentioned in Imperial records as holding out against full Unification for some considerable time; while tacitly recognizing the Emperor's dominance, the ruling monarchy of Boeotia used all manner of diplomacy in order to avoid losing power.  In a show of great patience and benevolence, the Emperor allowed the ruling family of Boeotia - the Yeselti - to carry on like this for over 150 years, with the intention that they would integrate themselves into unified Imperial Terra at their own speed and with as much dignity as possible.  Instead, the Yeselti clung onto their independence to the point where, firstly, the [[Imperial Army]] was forced to invade the province and finally, Legiones Astartes of the [[Thousand Sons]] were assigned to quash the trucculent little state.  Boeotia was notable both for the presence of industry and at least one buried shrine to gods worshiped by humans in an earlier age.{{Fn|4}}

*[[Caucasus Wastes]] - Its ruler, the ''ethnarch'', was defeated by the Emperor's forces and imprisoned in the dungeon of [[Khangba Marwu]].{{Fn|9a}}

*[[Franc]] - Absorbed by the forces of the Emperor.

*[[Hy Brasil]] - Its last independent ruler, [[Dalmoth Kyn]], was one of the last Terran warlords to be defeated by the Emperor. After their defeat Hy Brasil existed as semi-autonomous province within the Imperium, and was governed by Kyn's descendants. However the actions of [[Malcador the Sigillite]] ensured that Dalmoth's descendants, including [[Pherom Sichar]], never sat on the [[Council of Terra]] when it was created.{{Fn|2}}

*[[Merica]] - This major kingdom was known for its high fashion and ballrooms, fell to the Emperor's forces.{{Fn|9a}}

*[[Maulland Sen Confederacy]] - The Nordic-based Confederacy, unwittingly serving the [[Chaos Gods|Dark Gods]] by engaging in cannibalistic human sacrifice and forbidden genetic manipulation, was crushed by the Thunder Warriors in the [[Battle of Maulland Sen]]. Its ruler, the [[Priest-King of Maulland Sen]], was executed by the Emperor personally.{{Fn|15}}

*[[Oxitania]]- Ruled by King [[Gotha]] during the Unification Wars. Ultimately defeated, though at the cost of the near destruction of the [[VIII Legion]]'s 9th Company. The [[Crimson Sons|company remnants]] were oathbound to serve Gotha himself, as he had accepted the rank of Rogue Trader from the Emperor in remission of his execution. {{Fn|7b}}

*[[Panpacific Empire]] - The powerful Panpacific under its tyrant [[Narthan Dume]] was defeated by the forces of the Emperor. In a rare move, the Emperor had Dume executed instead of imprisoned.{{Fn|9a}}

*[[Ursh]] - Ruled over by the tyrant [[Kalagann]], Ursh employed powerful [[psyker]]s in its armies and used their might to unleash dark [[warp]] powers on its enemies. This did not, however, avail him when he faced the forces of the Emperor, who defeated and killed Kalagann.{{Fn|12}}

*[[Ethnarchy]] - The Ethnarchy is known to have commanded formidable forces consisting of genetically modified warriors known as the Ur-Khasis, dangerous weapons from the [[Dark Age of Technology]], and enslaved [[Psyker]]s. The first attempt by Imperial forces to capture the Ethnarchy's strongholds earlier in the war had cost the lives of 20,000 [[Thunder Warrior]]s and a million other casualties. Towards the end of the Unification Wars, the Emperor began his second attempt to topple the Ethnarchy. This time the [[XVIII Legion]] of the [[Legiones Astartes]] was tasked with destroying the subterranean power generators feeding the Ethnarchy's power fields. In the ensuing Assault on the Tempest Galleries, the XVIIIth Legion was victorious and with their force fields down, the Ethnarchy was quickly crushed by the forces of the Emperor.{{Fn|7c}}

*[[Yndonesic Bloc]] - The brutal Ethnarch of the bloc, [[Cardinal Tang]], was defeated by the forces of the Emperor and imprisoned.{{Fn|13}}

*[[Saragorn Enclave]] - the Enclave surrendered to the forces of the Emperor but still carried on the experiments in secret. When the Emperor discovered this defiance, he dispatched the [[VIII Legion|VIIIth Astartes Legion]]  to bring his retribution. The Enclave was viciously destroyed.{{Fn|7a}}

*[[Adedeji]] - This Dynasty ruled from northeastern Africa. After they were defeated by the Emperor they were reduced to lowly status, with many being forced to become factory workers.{{Fn|18}}

One of the last battles in [[Europa (Terra)|Europa]] was the [[Battle of Gaduare|Massacre at Gaduare]] in [[Franc]], where 5,000 Imperial Thunder Warriors slaughtered 50,000 rebel militia.{{Fn|5}} In 669.[[M30]], the last major battle of the Unification era saw the Emperor purge most of the Thunder Warriors at Mount Ararat, making way for his next generation of superhuman warriors, the [[Space Marines]].{{Fn|9}}{{Fn|21}} At some point after the purge of Mount Ararat, the [[Palace Coup]] was launched by dissident Imperials, including surviving Thunder Warriors, who had come to oppose the Emperor for various reasons. The uprising was crushed with the first mass use of Space Marines.{{Fn|19b}} From then on, Space Marines became a prominent part in the Imperial armies on Terra, and began developing their distinct, [[Space Marine Legion|Legion]]-specific characteristics. For example, the [[White Scars]] were used by the [[Emperor]] as an outriders probing enemy strongholds for weakness and striking where opportunity arose.{{Fn|17}}

Among the final anti-Imperial warlords to be brought low was [[Cardinal Tang]] who still resisted Imperial rule by 703.[[M30]],{{Fn|10a}}{{Fn|21}} when most of Terra had already submitted to the Imperium. In that year, the Emperor then set his sights on [[Luna]], [[First Pacification of Luna|occupying it in a quick campaign]].{{Fn|14}}{{Fn|21}} After his military victories the Emperor sought to spread his [[Imperial Truth]] across the planet, enforcing atheism and destroying the planet's churches. The final church of Terra, the [[Church of the Lightning Stone]], was destroyed shortly before the [[Great Crusade]].{{Fn|5}} The Unification Wars were officially declared over in 712.[[M30]].{{Fn|21}}

===Aftermath===
*{{Main|Great Crusade}}
After capturing Terra and Luna and winning the allegiance of the [[Mechanicum]] of [[Mars]], the Emperor launched his [[Great Crusade]]. Over the next 200 years, the Emperor spearheaded the Astartes Legions in reconquering much of the Galaxy and finding the lost [[Primarch]]s.{{Fn|7c}}

The '''Van Skorvold Cartel''' was a mercantile clan active in the [[Geryon Subsector]] that specialised in human trafficking, supplying labour across the subsector for the [[Departmento Munitorum]], the [[Imperial Navy]] and even the [[Adeptus Mechanicus]] (in the form of base stock for the construction of [[Servitor]]s).{{Fn|1a}}  [[Van Skorvold Star Fort|The group's headquarters]] were a converted [[Imperial Space Station|defence platform]] in orbit of the planet [[Lakonia]].{{Fn|1b}}

The cartel's crest was a planet flanked by a pair of stylised human twins.{{Fn|1a}}

At one point the head of the cartel was [[Diego Van Skorvold]].  After his death, leadership of the cartel passed to his offspring, [[Callisthenes Van Skorvold|Callisthenes]] and [[Veritas Van Skorvold]].{{Fn|1a}}

For many years there were rumours that the cartel was engaged in criminal activities, specifically the smuggling of artefacts and illegal [[mutant]]s.  Eventually the persistence of these claims led the [[Administratum|Adeptus Administratum]] to organise a raid on their base of operations, led by [[Consul Senioris]] [[Iocanthos Gullyan Kraevik Chloure|Chloure]].  Although he had support from the Imperial Navy and the Adeptus Mechanicus, Chloure decided to seek the assistance of the [[Space Marines]] to make sure the star fort was taken - to that end, he intentionally leaked information that the cartel had come into possession of a lost relic of the [[Soul Drinkers]] [[Chapter]], an ancient weapon known as the [[Soulspear]].  Sure enough, the Soul Drinkers sent a response force of roughly 300 Marines, led by [[Space Marine Commander|Commander]] [[Caeon]] to seize the station.{{Fn|1a}}

Although Caeon himself was killed during the mission, both Callisthenes and Veritas were captured{{Fn|1a}} and their star fort was destroyed{{Fn|1c}} - the ultimate fate of the cartel is unknown, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">A '''veteran''' is a soldier, be it from the [[Imperial Guard]], [[Space Marines]] or any other army, who has seen a great number of battle actions and survived. They are more experienced and hardened. Most of the time a veteran will be asigned to lead a squad or unit. Sometimes they will be formed into a separate unit. The [[Black Templars]] [[Sword Brethren]] and [[Space Wolves]] [[Wolf Guard]] are examples of this. In other Space Marine [[chapters]], the [[First Company]] is comprised solely of veterans.

Veterans are allowed to take equipment from the army's armoury whereas &quot;regular&quot; troops may not. With Space Marines for instance, veterans are the only troops allowed to use [[Terminator Armour]].

'''Void Born''' are [[Imperials]] who are not born on the [[Imperium]]'s worlds, but instead within the void of space. This includes asteroid mining installations, [[Space Stations]] and spacecrafts, with some Void Born being born as these vessels travel through the [[Warp]].{{Fn|1}}
==Description==
Those who live out their lives in space grow use to things, that world-bound [[Imperials]] fear or loathe, such as living in low or even zero-gravity environments. Never knowing the feel of solid ground beneath their feet also becomes commonplace for them as well. Void Born that dwell on spacecrafts become used to the reality-altering process of [[Warp]] travel. Generations of families can live this way, but in time gravitational pressures, inbreeding and Warp anomalies can take its toll. This has led the Void Born to develop pallid skin, drawn out features and some also have a minor deformity, or oddness about their speech, gait or general appearance{{Fn|1}}. Furthermore, it is possible that a world's gravity could begin to cause a Void Born to experience excruciating pain, should they spend too much time there.{{Fn|2}} 

All this separates them from world-bound [[Imperials]] and as a result, Void Born are considered an odd collection of misfits, strangers and ill-omened folk. The [[Warp]] itself is thought to have somehow tainted them as well and whether because of this belief or because of their perceived strange looks, clannish ways or unwholesome air, the Void Born are shunned and mistrusted by most in the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|1}}

The '''Wandering Inquisitor'''{{Fn|1}}, also known as '''Inquisitor Errant'''{{Fn|2}}, is a rumoured child of the [[Emperor]] known as a [[Sensei]]. The existence of the Sensei is known to few outside of the [[Illuminati]] and the deeper orders of the [[Inquisition]], and the Sensei are instead known through folk tales, such as that of ''the Wandering Inquisitor''.{{Fn|1}} During the events of the [[Inquisition War]], the ''Wandering Inquisitor'' was cornered on the planet [[Orbal]] by a an [[Inquisitor]] named [[Ion Dimitru]]. Dimitru was possibly a member of the [[Eternity Project]], whose goal was to eliminate [[Sensei|immortal mutants]]. However, as ''Errant'' was cornered within a bunker, Dimitru was slain by a member of the [[Illuminati]].{{Fn|2}}

==Trivia==
{{trivia}}

The ''Wandering Inquisitor'' is possibly inspired by the legend of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew Wandering Jew], a mythical immortal man ([[Sensei]] are also immortal).

[[The Waning]], was a period of time after the [[Redemption Crusades]], where, due to the exhaustion of the [[Imperium]]'s military, world after world and system after system fell to [[Ork]] invasion, [[Chaos]] insurgence, or plain rebellion. Some systems were turned over to [[Space Marine]] [[chapters]] for direct government.{{Fn|1}}

The War Council was an [[Imperial]] institution formed before the [[Great Crusade]] to organise and shape the course of the Crusade and the Imperial Military, but its remit extended to managing the Imperium as a whole.{{Fn|1}} After the formation of [[Council of Terra]] to manage civilian affairs, the War Council was reorganized under [[Warmaster]] [[Horus]] to only manage military affairs and to secure the new [[Imperium]]. A new War Council under [[Malcador (Character)|Malcador the Sigillite]] was convened on [[Terra]] following the outbreak of the [[Horus Heresy]].{{fn|5}}

Presumably, it was disbanded along with the Council of Terra during the reformations of [[Roboute Guilliman]].{{Fn|2}}

The '''War of the False Primarch''' was a dark and bloody episode of the [[Imperium]]'s history, now largely lost to myth and purged from all records, that plunged the [[Segmentum Pacificus]] into anarchy from 780.[[M33]] to 860.M33. The conflict was finally ended when the [[High Lords of Terra]], conveyed the [[Pentarchy of Blood]] and tasked five loyal [[Chapters]] to destroy eleven others, that had been declared [[Excommunicate Traitoris|Traitoris Perdita]] for their actions during the war.{{Fn|1}}

[[Image:Watcher in the Dark.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Watcher in the Dark holding the book for Dark Angel to read]]
'''Watchers in the Dark''' are a diminutive robed race of creatures which inhabit [[the Rock]], the mobile [[fortress-monastery]] of the [[Dark Angels]] [[Space Marine]] [[Chapter]].{{Fn|1}} 

==Overview==
The Watchers watched over the comatose body of the Dark Angel Primarch [[Lion El'Jonson]] within a secret chamber at the core of the Rock. They are semi-unique as they possess a near exclusive ability to resist the [[warp]] entities, a trait which is shared with the rare and mysterious [[Pariahs]] who completely nullify the warp around them. These silent creatures have been known to carry Dark Angels weapons to battle, and seem to be immune to all acts of violence. Dark Angels accompanied by them are destined to greatness, but they will never give direct aid in battle.{{Fn|1}}

Despite their usual silence and small stature, Watchers are intelligent creatures who psychically communicate with one another. They have been seeking to guide the Dark Angels against [[Chaos]] since before the [[Horus Heresy]], and are acquainted with the likes of [[Eldrad Ulthran]]. The Watchers seemed to welcome the coming [[Destruction of Caliban]], viewing it as their last hope in their ambitions against Chaos.{{Fn|4}}

==History==
Native creatures to [[Caliban]] according to [[Zahariel]], the Watchers in the Dark were encountered fighting Warp-tainted beasts on the world before the coming of the [[Emperor]].{{Fn|2}} According to the [[Ouroboros (artifact)|Ouroboros]], at some point the Watchers became its &quot;jailers&quot;. During the power struggle among [[The Fallen]] on Caliban as the [[Horus Heresy]] unfolded, the Watchers sided with the [[Lord Cypher]] against [[Astelan]] and [[Zahariel]].{{Fn|3}}

Following the [[Destruction of Caliban]] some of the Watchers survived and now inhabit a portion of their former homeworld, [[The Rock]]. They continue to aid the Dark Angels chapter in their own mysterious ways.{{Fn|1}}

Upon the awakening of [[Lion El'Jonson]] in [[Mirror-Caliban]], it was the Watchers who attempted to guide him back into the [[Imperium]].{{Fn|5}}

==Miniature==
[[File:Watcher in the Dark2.jpg|center|thumb|150px|A Watchers in the Dark miniature from GW]]

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
The Watchers in the Dark are probably named after the [[Wikipedia:Watchers|Watchers]], a type of biblical angel that is mentioned in various religious texts.

==Description==
The substances are illegal for [[Imperial]]s to [[Cold Trade|possess]] and those who are caught doing so by the [[Adeptus Arbites]], will be put on trial for the crime. Should they be found guilty by the Arbites' adjudicators, the offenders could be sentenced to death.{{Fn|1}}

'''Xenology''' is the [[Imperial]] study of [[Xenos]]. Those individuals who study xenology are known as '''Xenologists'''.{{Fn|1}}

The science has had a chequered history, however, and has been described as either [[Human|humanity's]] greatest hope or its greatest folly. There is no formal training to become a Xenologist, though practitioners will need to have the resources required to carry out their work.{{Fn|1}}
